    "text": "Prompt: Proto-Mechanism Theme Allocation Audit (One Theme at a Time)\nROLE You are supporting a realist evidence synthesis. Your task is to audit whether mechanisms currently assigned to ONE target proto-mechanism theme are allocated to the best-fitting theme.\nYou must classify by underlying generative causal process, not topic similarity.\nINPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE\n\ntarget_theme_id The theme ID to audit (e.g., PM17).\nproto_themes_yml The full current contents of: data/mechanism_themes/proto_themes.yml\nproto_themes_changelog_yml The full current contents of: data/mechanism_themes/proto_themes_changelog.yml\n\nREFERENCE EXTRACTION (PYTHON) — USE THIS WORKFLOW EVERY TIME\nUse this code structure to ensure you consistently compare mechanisms to ALL themes’ labels and explanations. (This is a workflow reference; do not execute it.)\nimport re\nimport yaml\n\nproto = yaml.safe_load(proto_themes_yml)  # dict\nthemes = proto[\"proto_mechanism_themes\"]  # list[dict]\n\ntheme_index = {\n  t[\"theme_id\"]: {\n    \"theme_label\": t[\"theme_label\"],\n    \"mechanism_explanation\": t[\"mechanism_explanation\"],\n  }\n  for t in themes\n}\n\ntarget_theme = next(t for t in themes if t[\"theme_id\"] == target_theme_id)\ncandidate_mechanisms = list(target_theme.get(\"mechanisms\", []))\n\nchangelog = yaml.safe_load(proto_themes_changelog_yml)\nexisting_ids = [\n  int(re.search(r\"CHG_(\\\\d+)$\", c[\"change_id\"]).group(1))\n  for c in changelog.get(\"change_log\", [])\n  if re.search(r\"CHG_(\\\\d+)$\", c.get(\"change_id\", \"\"))\n]\nnext_change_num = (max(existing_ids) + 1) if existing_ids else 1\nAUDIT TASK (FOR THE TARGET THEME ONLY)\nFor each mechanism currently inside the target theme:\n\nCompare the mechanism (its text) against EVERY theme’s:\n\n\ntheme_label\nmechanism_explanation\n\n\nDecide one outcome:\n\n\nKEEP IN TARGET THEME Only if the target theme’s explanation is the best match to the mechanism’s causal logic.\nREALLOCATE TO A DIFFERENT EXISTING THEME If another theme’s label/explanation clearly fits the mechanism better than the target theme.\nMARK AMBIGUOUS If the mechanism plausibly fits 2+ themes and you cannot decide confidently. Move it to ambiguous_mechanisms and list the likely theme IDs in possible_themes.\n\nDECISION RULES (STRICT)\n\nUse generative process similarity, not:\n\nshared outcomes\nshared country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the current max - theme_id: the destination theme ID (or AMBIGUOUS) - mechanism_id - summary: 1 sentence describing what changed (include from/to theme IDs) - rationale: 1–2 sentences justifying the change in terms of causal process fit\nOUTPUT FORMAT (TWO STRICT YAML DOCUMENTS)\nReturn TWO YAML documents separated by a line containing only ---.\nDocument 1 will be saved to: data/mechanism_themes/proto_themes.yml Document 2 will be saved to: data/mechanism_themes/proto_themes_changelog.yml\nDocument 1 MUST match this schema:\nproto_mechanism_themes: - theme_id: PM1

mechanism_explanation: Presenting offsets as economic benefits or conditional support shifts decision-makers’ and publics’\n    cost-benefit reasoning, making purchases more politically acceptable.\n  mechanisms:\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: By offering cost offsets framed as economic benefits, sellers provide an inducement that shifts decision-makers’\n      reasoning from reluctance to acceptance.\n    rationale: Frames offsets as economic benefits that shift decision-makers toward acceptance.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_002\n    text: By embedding compensatory work in an offset package, officials can present support to domestic producers as a condition\n      of purchase rather than a visible subsidy, reducing political costs.\n    rationale: Uses offset packaging to present support as a purchase condition, lowering political exposure.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: By making offsets appear to deliver large economic benefits (even if illusory), officials reduce perceived net costs\n      and increase public acceptance.\n    rationale: Emphasises perceived benefits to reduce net-cost perceptions and build public acceptance.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_021\n    text: Promised offset benefits provide an argument that reframes the purchase as economically beneficial, reducing resistance.\n    rationale: Reframes the purchase as economically beneficial to reduce resistance.\n  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because expected benefits are more salient than expected costs, officials adopt offsets even when net welfare effects\n      are ambiguous.\n    rationale: Benefit salience drives adoption despite ambiguous net welfare.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Buyer ability to extract economic activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to import superior foreign\n      systems, reinforcing exporter dominance while forcing work-sharing back to buyer countries.\n    rationale: Ability to extract activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to buy foreign systems.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Politicians use offset promises as persuasive rhetoric to frame weapons purchases as delivering wider economic development\n      benefits.\n    rationale: Offset promises frame purchases as economic development, increasing acceptability.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: By creating concentrated local benefits for the military, politicians, and firms, offsets generate supportive coalitions\n      that reduce political resistance to procurement.\n    rationale: Concentrated local benefits build supportive coalitions that reduce political resistance.\n  - id: 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: By offering offsets (including technology transfer and production arrangements) as inducements in defense sales,\n      the US reinforces alliance ties and supports interoperability and extended production.\n    rationale: Offsets as inducements in sales reinforce alliances and interoperability, increasing acceptance.\n  - id: 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_018\n    text: Offsets and arms sales reinforce political and alliance-building signals, which Taiwan values as assurance of ongoing\n      US security commitment.\n    rationale: Offsets and arms sales signal alliance commitment and assurance.\n  - id: 19_defense_industrial_participation_the_south_african_experience_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Officials emphasized offsets as promised economic benefits to shift public and political reasoning toward acceptance\n      of the arms purchase.\n    rationale: Offsets framed as promised benefits shift public/political acceptance.\n  - id: 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Promoters emphasize job creation and investment narratives to legitimize offsets as development tools, even as the\n      job-creation emphasis later weakens.\n    rationale: Job-creation narratives legitimate offsets as development tools.\n  - id: 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_017\n    text: Promised regional industrial participation benefits (e.g., Ferrostaal steel projects) can act as decisive inducements\n      in selecting higher-priced bids.\n    rationale: Promised regional benefits act as inducements in bid selection.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Arms sales paired with technology-transfer offsets build local capacity and simultaneously serve as a tool to reinforce\n      diplomatic and military ties.\n    rationale: Transfers build local capacity while reinforcing diplomatic/military ties.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Offsets are used to redirect some procurement-related value toward domestic industrial/technological upgrading and\n      to improve political acceptability; purchasers may pay a premium to place work locally.\n    rationale: Offsets redirect value to domestic upgrading and improve political acceptability.\n- theme_id: PM2\n  theme_label: Compliance shaped by incentives and monitoring\n  mechanism_explanation: 'Delivery depends on the enforcement regime: transparency and credible incentives/penalties encourage\n    compliance, while weak oversight and accounting games reduce real fulfilment.'\n  mechanisms:\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_004\n    text: Shifts in conditions, contractor fortunes, or bad faith reduce the ability and incentives to complete promised offset\n      activities, especially when enforcement is weak.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement and changing conditions reduce incentives and capacity to fulfil obligations.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Structuring offset agreements to maximize transparency and create credible incentives/penalties increases supplier\n      compliance with offset obligations.\n    rationale: Transparency plus credible incentives/penalties raise compliance with obligations.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery\n      without creating genuinely additional business.\n    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement\n      is difficult in practice.\n    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement\n      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.\n    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.\n  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019\n    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,\n      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.\n    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008\n    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment\n      value.\n    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016\n    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement\n      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids provides an informal enforcement incentive to meet offset targets.\n    rationale: Informal threat of future bid exclusion incentivizes compliance.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Multipliers and penalty-backed obligations increase incentives for investment and technology transfer into pre-determined\n      local sectors.\n    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated\n      and accountability weakens.\n    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce\n      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.\n    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Reducing multipliers or evaluating them case-by-case limits artificial inflation of offset value and shifts emphasis\n      to verifiable projects.\n    rationale: Reducing multipliers or reviewing them case-by-case limits inflated credit values.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Restricting banking (time limits, transfer limits, caps on proportion satisfied) preserves closer coupling between\n      current procurement and compensatory activity.\n    rationale: Restricting banking preserves coupling between procurement and compensatory activity.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_007\n    text: Denmark avoids financial penalties because it acknowledges penalties raise import prices, instead using supplier\n      blacklisting; Norway uses withheld-payment sanctions; Finland/Sweden accept economic sanctions.\n    rationale: Sanctions/blacklisting create enforcement incentives without necessarily raising prices via penalties.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Complex and heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentage values from actual work delivered, complicating\n      audits and comparisons.\n    rationale: Complex arrangements decouple headline percentages from real delivery, complicating audits.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Because supplier contribution to deal initiation cannot be established and some projects would have occurred anyway,\n      fulfillment rates can be inflated by multiplier pricing, consultants, and advance crediting.\n    rationale: Multipliers and advance crediting inflate fulfillment where projects would occur anyway.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Lack of clear requirements and approval criteria enables retroactive crediting and preferential treatment, reducing\n      competition and potentially raising prices.\n    rationale: Vague criteria enable retroactive crediting and preferential treatment, undermining competition.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Making policy more specific, setting approval criteria in advance, and requiring competitive bidding and continuous\n      monitoring improves transparency and limits distortions.\n    rationale: Clear criteria, competitive bidding, and monitoring improve transparency and reduce distortions.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because additionality is difficult to measure and work may be re-labeled or low quality, credited projects do not\n      reliably represent new economic activity.\n    rationale: Relabeling or low-quality work undermines additionality and accountability.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Through pre-compensations (offset banking credits), suppliers count normal trade flows as offsets against future\n      obligations.\n    rationale: Pre-compensation credits allow normal trade to count against future obligations.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: By applying multipliers (including exceptionally high ones), policymakers can inflate credited offset value beyond\n      underlying transaction costs, enabling “headline” offset totals.\n    rationale: High multipliers inflate credited offset value beyond underlying transactions.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Non-terminable agreements and liquidated damages (up to 100% of outstanding obligations) raise expected costs of\n      non-compliance and are intended to enforce delivery.\n    rationale: Strong penalties and non-terminable agreements raise non-compliance costs to enforce delivery.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_009\n    text: Parallel bargaining and the option to specify projects allow the buyer to attempt to reduce ambiguity and lock suppliers\n      into concrete deliverables.\n    rationale: Parallel bargaining and project specification reduce ambiguity and lock suppliers into deliverables.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Because credited value is set to reflect value to the economy rather than actual provision costs, administrative\n      crediting can decouple “credit” from real effort.\n    rationale: Administrative crediting can decouple value credited from real effort.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Multipliers and differing valuation conventions enable large gaps between “nominal,” “net,” and “gross” reported\n      offset values, complicating verification.\n    rationale: Multipliers and valuation conventions create large gaps between nominal and net values.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: By insisting on specific offset projects and obligations rather than an open agreement, Poland attempts to lock\n      in hard commitments and reduce supplier discretion.\n    rationale: Specific projects and obligations reduce supplier discretion and lock in commitments.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_015\n    text: Low liquidated-damages rates reduce the expected cost of non-performance, making it rational for a supplier to pay\n      penalties instead of fully discharging obligations in some cases.\n    rationale: Low liquidated damages lower expected non-performance costs, enabling strategic non-compliance.\n  - id: 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_018\n    text: Multipliers raise credited value for higher-priority activities (technology transfer, training, licensing/copro)\n      and thereby steer supplier effort toward capability-building deliverables.\n    rationale: Multipliers steer effort toward capability-building deliverables by inflating credit values.\n  - id: 14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: A knowledgeable negotiating team can secure more favorable, capability-relevant terms and reduce asymmetric-information\n

16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: The threat of banning contractors from future competitions increases incentives to fulfill offset obligations.\n    rationale: Future-ban threats increase incentives to fulfill obligations.\n  - id: 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Mandating offset obligations and tracking acquittals creates stronger compliance incentives and clearer reporting,\n      even though compliance may not equal net benefit.\n    rationale: Mandated obligations and tracking strengthen compliance incentives and reporting.\n  - id: 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Eligibility criteria plus multipliers steer suppliers toward higher-valued activities (e.g., R&D and training) by\n      making them “count” more toward obligations.\n    rationale: Eligibility criteria and multipliers steer suppliers toward higher-valued activities.\n  - id: 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_004\n    text: Project Deeds, Credit Deeds, and liquidated damages create enforceable commitments and rewards for longer-term programs,\n

19_defense_industrial_participation_the_south_african_experience_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: A quantified obligation (percent of imported content) plus a defined fulfillment window compels suppliers to design\n      “credit-generating” projects to meet targets.\n    rationale: Quantified obligations and windows compel design of credit-generating projects.\n  - id: 19_defense_industrial_participation_the_south_african_experience_pdf__cmo_007\n    text: If paying penalties is easier than delivering substantive participation, suppliers may renege and accept the financial\n      cost rather than implement projects.\n    rationale: If penalties are cheaper, suppliers may choose to pay rather than perform.\n  - id:

price to recoup offset costs.\n    rationale: Passes offset costs into the sale price to recover premiums.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_004\n    text: Because there is no unique benchmark price, suppliers can embed offset-related costs into the offered weapons price\n      without the buyer being able to verify price padding.\n    rationale: Lack of benchmark prices enables embedding offset costs into the sale price.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Suppliers accept offset obligations only when the overall package yields satisfactory returns, adjusting the weapons\n      price upward if needed or walking away otherwise.\n    rationale: Suppliers raise prices to maintain returns or exit if obligations undermine profitability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Vendors treat offset costs as a pricing issue and attempt to load costs into the

text: Suppliers incur offset-related overhead and transfer costs that are priced into the contract, while buyers accept\n      higher prices as an investment.\n    rationale: Offset overhead and transfer costs are priced into contracts as buyer-accepted investments.\n  - id: 14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Currency devaluation reduces the real (USD-equivalent) value of government payments, increasing contract risk and\n      prompting renegotiation or exit threats.\n    rationale: Currency devaluation raises contract risk and prompts

country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the

sales paired with technology-transfer offsets build local capacity and simultaneously serve as a tool to reinforce\n      diplomatic and military ties.\n    rationale: Transfers build local capacity while reinforcing diplomatic/military ties.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Offsets are used to redirect some procurement-related value toward domestic industrial/technological upgrading and\n      to improve political acceptability; purchasers may pay a premium to place work locally.\n    rationale: Offsets redirect value to domestic upgrading and improve political acceptability.\n- theme_id: PM2\n  theme_label: Compliance shaped by incentives and monitoring\n  mechanism_explanation: 'Delivery depends on the enforcement regime: transparency and

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Structuring offset agreements to maximize transparency and create credible incentives/penalties increases supplier\n

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery\n      without creating genuinely additional business.\n    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement\n      is difficult in practice.\n    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement\n      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.\n    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.\n  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019\n    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,\n      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.\n    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008\n    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment\n      value.\n    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016\n    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement\n      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids provides an informal enforcement incentive to meet offset targets.\n    rationale: Informal threat of future bid exclusion incentivizes compliance.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Multipliers and penalty-backed obligations increase incentives for investment and technology transfer into pre-determined\n      local sectors.\n    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated\n      and accountability weakens.\n    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce\n      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.\n    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Reducing multipliers or evaluating them case-by-case limits artificial inflation of offset value and shifts emphasis\n      to verifiable projects.\n    rationale: Reducing multipliers or reviewing them case-by-case limits inflated credit values.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Restricting banking (time limits, transfer limits, caps on proportion satisfied) preserves closer coupling between\n      current procurement and compensatory activity.\n    rationale:

Move it to ambiguous_mechanisms and list the likely theme IDs in possible_themes.\n\nDECISION RULES (STRICT)\n\nUse generative process similarity, not:\n\nshared outcomes\nshared country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the current max - theme_id: the destination theme ID (or AMBIGUOUS) - mechanism_id - summary: 1 sentence describing what changed (include from/to theme IDs) - rationale: 1–2 sentences justifying the

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_021\n    text: Promised offset benefits provide an argument that reframes the purchase as economically beneficial, reducing resistance.\n    rationale: Reframes the purchase as economically beneficial to reduce resistance.\n  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because expected benefits are more salient than expected costs, officials adopt offsets even when net welfare effects\n      are ambiguous.\n    rationale: Benefit salience drives adoption despite ambiguous net welfare.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Buyer ability to extract economic activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to import superior foreign\n      systems, reinforcing exporter dominance while forcing work-sharing back to buyer countries.\n    rationale: Ability to extract activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to buy foreign systems.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Politicians use offset promises as persuasive rhetoric to frame weapons purchases as delivering wider economic

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery\n      without creating genuinely additional business.\n    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement\n      is difficult in practice.\n    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement\n      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.\n    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.\n  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019\n    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,\n      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.\n    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008\n    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment\n      value.\n    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016\n    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement\n      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids

local sectors.\n    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated\n      and accountability weakens.\n    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce\n      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.\n    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Reducing multipliers or evaluating them case-by-case limits artificial inflation of offset value and shifts emphasis\n      to

Restricting banking preserves coupling between procurement and compensatory activity.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_007\n    text: Denmark avoids financial penalties because it acknowledges penalties raise import prices, instead using supplier\n      blacklisting; Norway uses withheld-payment sanctions; Finland/Sweden accept economic sanctions.\n    rationale: Sanctions/blacklisting create enforcement incentives without necessarily raising prices via penalties.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Complex and heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentage values from actual work delivered, complicating\n      audits and comparisons.\n    rationale: Complex arrangements decouple headline percentages from real delivery, complicating audits.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Because supplier contribution to deal initiation cannot be established and some projects would have occurred anyway,\n      fulfillment rates can be inflated by multiplier pricing, consultants, and advance crediting.\n    rationale: Multipliers and advance crediting inflate fulfillment where projects would occur anyway.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Lack of

12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Because credited value is set to reflect value to the economy rather than actual provision costs, administrative\n      crediting can decouple “credit” from real effort.\n    rationale: Administrative crediting can decouple value credited from real effort.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Multipliers and differing valuation conventions enable large gaps between “nominal,” “net,” and “gross” reported\n

country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the

sales paired with technology-transfer offsets build local capacity and simultaneously serve as a tool to reinforce\n      diplomatic and military ties.\n    rationale: Transfers build local capacity while reinforcing diplomatic/military ties.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Offsets are used to redirect some procurement-related value toward domestic industrial/technological upgrading and\n      to improve political acceptability; purchasers may pay a premium to place work locally.\n    rationale: Offsets redirect value to domestic upgrading and improve political acceptability.\n- theme_id: PM2\n  theme_label: Compliance shaped by incentives and monitoring\n  mechanism_explanation: 'Delivery depends on the enforcement regime: transparency and

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Structuring offset agreements to maximize transparency and create credible incentives/penalties increases supplier\n

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery\n      without creating genuinely additional business.\n    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement\n      is difficult in practice.\n    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement\n      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.\n    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.\n  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019\n    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,\n      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.\n    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008\n    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment\n      value.\n    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016\n    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement\n      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids provides an informal enforcement incentive to meet offset targets.\n    rationale: Informal threat of future bid exclusion incentivizes compliance.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Multipliers and penalty-backed obligations increase incentives for investment and technology transfer into pre-determined\n      local sectors.\n    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated\n      and accountability weakens.\n    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce\n      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.\n    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Reducing multipliers or evaluating them case-by-case limits artificial inflation of offset value and shifts emphasis\n      to verifiable projects.\n    rationale: Reducing multipliers or reviewing them case-by-case limits inflated credit values.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Restricting banking (time limits, transfer limits, caps on proportion satisfied) preserves closer coupling between\n      current procurement and compensatory activity.\n    rationale:

country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the current max - theme_id: the destination theme ID (or AMBIGUOUS) - mechanism_id - summary: 1 sentence describing what changed (include from/to theme IDs) - rationale: 1–2 sentences justifying the

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_021\n    text: Promised offset benefits provide an argument that reframes the purchase as economically beneficial, reducing resistance.\n    rationale: Reframes the purchase as economically beneficial to reduce resistance.\n  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because expected benefits are more salient than expected costs, officials adopt offsets even when net welfare effects\n      are ambiguous.\n    rationale: Benefit salience drives adoption despite ambiguous net welfare.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Buyer ability to extract economic activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to import superior foreign\n      systems, reinforcing exporter dominance while forcing work-sharing back to buyer countries.\n    rationale: Ability to extract activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to buy foreign systems.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Politicians use offset promises as persuasive rhetoric to frame weapons purchases as delivering wider economic

01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery\n      without creating genuinely additional business.\n    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement\n      is difficult in practice.\n    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement\n      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.\n    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.\n  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019\n    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,\n      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.\n    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008\n    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment\n      value.\n    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016\n    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement\n      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids

local sectors.\n    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated\n      and accountability weakens.\n    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce\n      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.\n    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Reducing multipliers or evaluating them case-by-case limits artificial inflation of offset value and shifts emphasis\n      to

Restricting banking preserves coupling between procurement and compensatory activity.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_007\n    text: Denmark avoids financial penalties because it acknowledges penalties raise import prices, instead using supplier\n      blacklisting; Norway uses withheld-payment sanctions; Finland/Sweden accept economic sanctions.\n    rationale: Sanctions/blacklisting create enforcement incentives without necessarily raising prices via penalties.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Complex and heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentage values from actual work delivered, complicating\n      audits and comparisons.\n    rationale: Complex arrangements decouple headline percentages from real delivery, complicating audits.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Because supplier contribution to deal initiation cannot be established and some projects would have occurred anyway,\n      fulfillment rates can be inflated by multiplier pricing, consultants, and advance crediting.\n    rationale: Multipliers and advance crediting inflate fulfillment where projects would occur anyway.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Lack of

12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Because credited value is set to reflect value to the economy rather than actual provision costs, administrative\n      crediting can decouple “credit” from real effort.\n    rationale: Administrative crediting can decouple value credited from real effort.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Multipliers and differing valuation conventions enable large gaps between “nominal,” “net,” and “gross” reported\n

Your task is to identify and group mechanism statements into proto-mechanism themes.\nYou are working inductively. There are no pre-existing themes.\nYour core analytic question is:\n“Are these different surface descriptions of the same underlying generative process?”\nA generative process explains how or why an outcome is produced (e.g., learning, dependency, trust formation, signalling, institutional friction).\nINPUT\nYou will receive a list of mechanism statements, each with an ID.\nMechanisms describe causal processes, not just events or outcomes.\nANALYTIC RULES 1) Focus on causal processes\nGroup statements that describe the same type of underlying mechanism, even if wording, actors, sectors, or outcomes differ.\n\nIgnore outcomes for now\n\nDo not cluster based on similar outcomes (e.g., delays, interoperability, cost growth). Focus only on how the outcome is generated.\n\nDo NOT group by:\n\nshared country or programme\nshared sector\ngeneral topic similarity (e.g., “technology”, “industry”)\nshared outcomes only\n\nEach cluster must represent ONE mechanism\n\nIf two statements involve “technology transfer” but describe different processes (e.g., learning vs. restriction), they belong in different themes.\n\nUse AMBIGUOUS when necessary\n\nIf a mechanism could plausibly reflect more than one underlying process and cannot be confidently grouped, mark it as AMBIGUOUS.\nTASKS\nStep 1 — Interpret mechanisms\nFor each statement, identify the underlying generative process it appears to describe.\nStep 2 — Form proto-mechanism themes\nGroup mechanisms that reflect the same generative logic.\nStep 3 — Name each theme\nProvide a short label (3–6 words) describing the mechanism.\nGood examples:\n“Trust building through co-production”\n“Capability dependency on foreign suppliers”\n“Learning-by-doing in domestic industry”\n“Political signalling via industrial cooperation”\n“Administrative burden from compliance”\nBad examples:\n“Technology issues”\n“Industrial effects”\nStep 4 — Explain each mechanism theme\nWrite 1–2 sentences describing the shared causal process in realist terms (how it works and why it produces effects).\nStep 5 — Justify assignments\nFor each mechanism in a theme, explain briefly:\n“This belongs here because it describes the process where…”\nStep 6 — Flag ambiguous mechanisms\nList any mechanisms that could fit multiple themes and explain why classification is uncertain.\nCONSTRAINTS - Keep every original mechanism ID and statement text intact. - Do not invent or split mechanism statements. - Use concise rationales (1 sentence each). - Do not add commentary outside the required YAML. - Do not omit any mechanism.\nYAML CHECKLIST - Output valid YAML only (no preamble or epilogue). - Use spaces for indentation (no tabs). - Keep consistent indentation (2 spaces per level). - Quote strings containing punctuation. - Ensure every list item starts with “-”.\nOUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT YAML) proto_mechanism_themes: - theme_id: PM1 theme_label: “Trust building through co-production” mechanism_explanation: “Repeated joint production fosters interpersonal and organisational trust, shaping expectations and willingness for future collaboration.” mechanisms: - id: MECH_001 text: “Full mechanism statement” rationale: “Describes trust emerging from sustained joint work.” - id: MECH_007 text: “Full mechanism statement” rationale: “Reflects the same trust-building process despite different wording.”\n\ntheme_id: PM2 theme_label: “Capability dependency on foreign suppliers” mechanism_explanation: “Domestic capability gaps lead actors to rely on foreign firms, creating structural dependence that shapes long-term industrial and strategic choices.” mechanisms:\n\nid: MECH_003 text: “Full mechanism statement” rationale: “Describes reliance caused by capability shortfall.”\n\n\nambiguous_mechanisms: - id: MECH_011 text: “Full mechanism statement” possible_themes: [PM2, PM4] explanation: “Could reflect dependency or political signalling depending on actor intent.”"

    "text": "You are extracting realist-style Context–Mechanism–Outcome (CMO) configurations from ONE document at a time.\nDEFINITIONS (MUST APPLY) - Context (C): The salient conditions that shape whether/how the mechanism fires (e.g., institutional rules, alliance relationships, procurement regime, industrial base maturity, governance capacity, threat environment). Context should be a condition or setting, not a program action; it can include pre-existing structures, constraints, incentives, or capacities. - Mechanism (M): The underlying generative causal process that produces change, typically framed as: (programme resources/constraints) + (actors’ reasoning/response) -&gt; causal force Mechanisms are NOT the same as activities, outputs, or policies (avoid “setting up an office”, “signing an MoU” as mechanisms). The mechanism should explain why actors respond the way they do given the resources/constraints. - Outcome (O): The observed (or credibly reported) effect(s), intended or unintended (e.g., interoperability, security of supply, cost/schedule impacts, corruption risk, industrial capability, alliance integration). Outcomes are effects or changes, not activities or plans.\nTASK 1) Read document_text carefully. 2) Identify and extract ALL defensible CMO configurations evidenced in the document. - Prefer “small” CMOs anchored to a specific claim/passage. - Do not stop at the first CMO; include additional distinct CMOs if the text supports them. - If the document only implies a CMO, you may still extract it but set confidence to low and make the inference explicit in the paraphrase. 3) Write each C, M, and O concisely (ideally 1–3 sentences each). 4) Populate metadata fields: - programme: name of the programme linked to the offset deal (snake_case). If not stated, use unknown_programme (do NOT guess). - country: snake_case country name; use multi_country if needed; if not stated, use unknown_country. - research_questions_mapped: list of RQ IDs from the list below (e.g., [rq1, rq3]) - evidence_type: one of case_study | comparative_case_study | theory_model | legal_analysis | policy_report | survey_experiment | systematic_review | qualitative_interviews | mixed_methods | other - evidence_type_narrative: 1–2 sentences describing what kind of material this is and why you chose evidence_type. - supporting_evidence: a SHORT direct quote (max ~25 words) that supports the CMO. Use double quotes inside YAML; escape internal quotes. If no suitable short quote exists, use “” and rely on paraphrase. - supporting_evidence_paraphrase: 1–2 sentences paraphrasing the supporting passage and how it supports the CMO (may note if inference is being made). - confidence: low | medium | high based on how directly the text supports the CMO. - confidence_justification: 1–2 sentences explaining the confidence rating (e.g., direct explicit CMO vs partial/implicit, specificity of evidence).\nVALIDATION AND VERIFICATION (V&V) REQUIREMENTS - Validate each CMO against the source text: - supporting_evidence must directly support the CMO; if not, lower confidence and say so in the paraphrase. - If the CMO is inferred, explicitly state that in the paraphrase and set confidence to low. - Ensure context is a condition/setting (not an activity or policy). - Ensure mechanism is a causal process linking resources/constraints to actors’ reasoning/response (not just an activity or policy). - Ensure outcome is an effect or change (observed or credibly reported) and do not overclaim beyond the text. - Ensure programme and country values are snake_case. - Produce a V&V log summarizing checks, issues, and any adjustments.\nOUTPUT RULES (MUST FOLLOW) - Output ONLY valid YAML (no markdown, no commentary). - The YAML top level MUST be a mapping keyed by the FILE NAME exactly as given in file_name. - Under the file key, include ONLY: - cmos: a mapping from unique CMO IDs to CMO objects - v_and_v_log: a list of V&V entries (may be empty) - If you find no defensible CMO, output: : cmos: {} v_and_v_log: - check: no_defensible_cmo status: pass note: “No defensible CMO found in this document.” - Each CMO ID MUST be derived from the file name: a) Create file_slug by: - lowercasing - replacing all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores - collapsing multiple underscores to one - trimming leading/trailing underscores b) Append __cmo_### where ### is a zero-padded 3-digit index starting at 001. - Each CMO object MUST have exactly these keys (and in this order): context mechanism outcome programme country evidence_type evidence_type_narrative research_questions_mapped supporting_evidence supporting_evidence_paraphrase confidence confidence_justification - Programme/country values MUST be snake_case. - Lists MUST be valid YAML lists (use hyphens). - Avoid long quotations; do not invent facts not supported by the text.\nV&V LOG FORMAT - Each v_and_v_log entry MUST have exactly these keys: check status note - status must be one of: pass | warn | fail - Include at least these checks per file: - completeness_all_relevant_cmos - evidence_traceability - context_is_condition - mechanism_is_causal - outcome_is_effect - snake_case_fields - quote_length - inference_flagged\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS (choose any that fit; can assign multiple per CMO) - rq1: Alliance relevance and mechanisms — Through what mechanisms do offset or industrial participation policies affect alliance-relevant outcomes such as interoperability, standardisation, security of supply, readiness, and the ability to contribute rapidly to NATO operations? - rq2: Conditions for durable collaboration — Under what conditions do offsets lead to durable industrial collaboration with allies and close partners (co-development, co-production, licensed production, shared sustainment/MRO, trusted supply chains)? - rq3: Risks and mitigation — What partnership risks are most commonly associated with offsets (corruption vulnerability, export-control friction, programme fragmentation, market distortion, cost/schedule impacts), and what mitigations/governance designs reduce these risks? - rq4: Positive comparative cases — Which countries combine continuing offset/industrial participation policy with high allied programme integration, and what design features enable coexistence? - rq5: Negative or mixed comparative cases — Which countries exhibit offset-related frictions that undermine partnership/alliance integration outcomes, and what policy design features appear implicated?\nNOW DO THE EXTRACTION FOR THE PROVIDED INPUTS AND OUTPUT ONLY YAML."

Mechanism: offering technology transfer/production arrangements within sales packages reinforces alliance ties and supports interoperability aims. Outcome: defence sales proceed with industrial compensation explicitly embedding alliance-building and interoperability goals. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_001)\nInteroperability-driven technology sharing under constraint: In contexts where interoperability requirements are tied to sensitive technologies, interoperability can require technology release. Mechanism: achieving interoperability necessitates sharing sensitive technology with partners (sometimes conditional on technology-access arrangements and approvals). Outcome: sensitive technology is shared with partners; governance around technology release becomes an active constraint on the pathway. (hagelin_12_pdf__cmo_002, 08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_006)\nInteroperability as a driver of costly acceleration dynamics: In contexts combining interoperability priorities with budget constraints and political pressure, technology sharing is framed as creating pressure to advance next-generation development. Mechanism: interoperability/technology sharing is used to justify accelerating “next generation” development to preserve an edge. Outcome: higher taxpayer costs and an arms-race dynamic among allies. (05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_017)\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect offsets building maintenance/modification competence: In contexts where imported systems generate sustainment dependence, direct military offsets can be targeted at maintenance and modification capacity. Mechanism: offsets provide resources/training/work packages that build local maintenance and modification capability, shifting actors toward in-country sustainment. Outcome: strengthened domestic sustainment competence supporting readiness. (10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_017, 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_021)\nTargeted MRO skill formation through selective cooperation: In contexts of small-state constraints and explicit prioritisation of sustainment skills, offsets/IP are used selectively for training and specialised repair/upgrade activities. Mechanism: collaboration and training requirements focus learning-by-doing on readiness-critical subsystems rather than broad industrialisation. Outcome: expanded MRO/upgrade capacity and improved overhaul capability for lifecycle support. (17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_013, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_014, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_015)\nRe-focusing offsets towards defence-relevant sustainment outcomes: In contexts where policy shifts away from civil/economic offsets toward defence-technology competence (and/or where military requirements must dominate procurement), offset demands are redirected. Mechanism: restricting offsets’ role in supplier selection and prioritising defence-relevant technology/sustainment objectives reduces distortion and concentrates offset effort on lifecycle-support competencies. Outcome: offsets are redirected to defence-industrial participation and maintenance/technology competence and constrained to a secondary role in procurement evaluation. (10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_016, 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_004, 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008)\nBoundary conditions from scale and duration of support: In contexts of very small fleets and limited support commitments, sustainment economics become fragile. Mechanism: small scale and short windows for spares/support weaken long-term supportability and deter external buyers. Outcome: high sustainment costs and reduced export viability (with sustainment activity potentially persisting only in narrow forms).

Mechanism: offsets function as an “insurance” logic and/or build maintenance capacity that reduces vulnerability to external suppliers. Outcome: improved security of supply / strengthened national security (noting this includes theory-model framing). (kanniainen_17_pdf__cmo_002, kanniainen_17_pdf__cmo_003, 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_017)\nAutonomy through software/mission-system control (and export-control friction): In contexts where autonomy goals hinge on software maintenance and technology evolution, buyers design offsets around technology transfer to enable in-country control. Mechanism: creating domestic entities for software development/technology absorption and requiring transfer of sensitive artefacts increases control over operation, maintenance, and upgrades; suppliers’ willingness/ability to release technology becomes a binding constraint. Outcome: strengthened operational/maintenance autonomy, with bidder disadvantage where source-code transfer is non-negotiable. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_017, 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_019, 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_020)\nInteroperability path dependence reducing supplier diversity: In contexts where operational interoperability with US-made systems increases in importance, procurement choices can narrow toward US systems and US-led models. Mechanism: interoperability requirements constrain feasible sourcing and reinforce a path-dependent procurement trajectory. Outcome: reduced supplier diversity and greater reliance on JSF-style buy-multinational procurement models. (18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_021)\nConstrained autonomy and diluted defence linkage through indirect offsets: In contexts where offsets/DIP are used to keep an in-country defence industry viable but obligations are met via indirect offsets/investment, defence linkage can dilute. Mechanism: broadening compliance space beyond defence work sustains firms and regional activity but can undercut ambitions for an independent defence industrial base and leave key capabilities underdeveloped. Outcome: constrained autonomy, diluted defence linkage, and missed capability development (e.g., shipbuilding proper). (20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_009, 19_defense_industrial_participation_the_south_african_experience_pdf__cmo_008, 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_020)\nSupplier discovery as a potential security-of-supply pathway (tentative): In contexts of uncertain supplier efficiency, offsets are described as enabling discovery of efficient suppliers and long-term partnerships. Mechanism: offset-linked engagement reveals new suppliers and builds relationships. Outcome: improved supply-chain integration, with security-of-supply benefits described as possible rather than demonstrated. (ianakiev_14_pdf__cmo_004)\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning-by-doing via licensed production and staged localisation: In contexts of sustained procurement-linked production arrangements, capability accumulation is framed as incremental. Mechanism: technology transfer, training, assembly/parts manufacture, and continued production create learning curves and absorptive capacity over time. Outcome: improved industrial capability/technology absorption and increased local content/production capability. (15_the_role_of_offsets_in_indian_defense_procurement_policy_pdf__cmo_004, 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_017, 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_001)\nAbsorptive capacity as a moderator of technology-transfer effectiveness: In contexts with stronger R&D institutions and educated personnel, technology transfer is more readily internalised and extended. Mechanism: human-capital and institutional capacity increases absorptive capacity, shaping how much transferred technology becomes domestically usable. Outcome: more effective “technology ladder” ascent under structured institutional capacity. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_003, 15_the_role_of_offsets_in_indian_defense_procurement_policy_pdf__cmo_004)\nSupply-chain insertion and capability-preserving participation: In contexts where industrial participation is constrained by value-for-money procurement, IP is structured to avoid displacing capability/price priorities. Mechanism: requiring defence-related, technically equivalent work within contract constraints incentivises supply-chain insertion (including via SMEs) while keeping IP secondary in award decisions. Outcome: procurement priority preserved with benefits flowing to SMEs through supply-chain insertion. (07_comparing_british_and_german_offset_strategies_pdf__cmo_003)\nSustaining high-technology niches in small states: In contexts of small-state constraints and high-technology sector priorities, offsets/IP provide access to specialised production and know-how. Mechanism: offset-linked work and (partly) foreign-financed investments channel resources into domestic firms that sustain and upgrade capabilities otherwise hard to finance. Outcome: sustained aerospace/engine manufacturing capabilities and improved technical know-how. (11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_004, 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_001)\nDomestic prime leadership in co-development enabling higher-end capability: In contexts where the buyer maintains financial/budgetary leadership and a domestic prime role in program structure, technology transfers are embedded within a domestic-led production/integration effort. Mechanism: domestic prime authority + embedded transfers build manufacturing and integration capability while preserving export flexibility. Outcome: higher-end aerospace capability and export positioning. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_014)\nCapability erosion under offset-dependent participation: In contexts where industrial participation is mainly offset-dependent work (rather than substantive collaboration or independent programmes), design and systems-integration learning can be reduced. Mechanism: reliance on offset-dependent tasks reduces opportunities to build/retain high-end design and integration experience. Outcome: erosion of long-run national design/systems-integration capability. (08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_005)\n\n\n\n\n\nComplex governance and non-competitive work splitting increasing cost/delay: In contexts of collaborative procurement with juste-retour style work allocation and multi-layer governance, programmes become administratively heavy. Mechanism: non-competitive splitting and committee structures increase transaction costs, blur accountability, and slow decisions. Outcome: inefficiency, higher costs, and programme delays. (08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001)\nRelaxing strict work-share rules as an efficiency pathway (contingent): In contexts where collaborative procurement tensions exist around juste-retour vs alternative work-share approaches, shifting work-share rules is treated as a lever. Mechanism: moving from strict national shares toward “global balance” reduces fragmentation and can improve collaborative efficiency, but depends on political agreement and acceptance of perceived disadvantages. Outcome: improved efficiency / reduced fragmentation (conditional). (07_comparing_british_and_german_offset_strategies_pdf__cmo_009)\nConstraining offsets to reduce procurement distortion: In contexts where procurement must be driven by military requirements and value-for-money, offsets are explicitly constrained. Mechanism: prohibiting offsets from influencing supplier choice until requirements are met reduces distortion in capability selection. Outcome: offsets take a secondary role in procurement evaluation. (09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008, 07_comparing_british_and_german_offset_strategies_pdf__cmo_003)\nSteering supplier behaviour with eligibility criteria and multipliers (governance instrument): In contexts where offset programmes specify what “counts” and provide multipliers, suppliers are nudged toward higher-valued activities. Mechanism: eligibility rules and multipliers reshape incentives, increasing proposals for R&D/training and other preferred activities relative to low-value or relabelled work. Outcome: contractors focus on technology-intensive activities (as credited compliance behaviour). (18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_003)\nShift away from ill-focused offsets toward more specific provisions: In contexts where offsets are judged ill-focused, states replace broad offset approaches with narrower mechanisms. Mechanism: targeting sustainment-relevant capabilities and then substituting contract-specific provisions/local-content requirements aims to concentrate on self-reliance-relevant outcomes while reducing offset-related inefficiencies. Outcome: offsets abolished de facto and replaced by more specific contractual provisions. (18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_005)\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsets/IP as political assurance within alliance relationships: In contexts of tenuous security environments and high dependence on an external guarantor, offsets and arms sales can be valued for assurance effects. Mechanism: offset-inclusive purchases reinforce political/alliance-building signals, shaping decision-makers’ willingness to continue offset-inclusive procurement. Outcome: continued pursuit of offsets for political assurance alongside industrial benefits. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_018, 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_001)\nOffsets creating network ties that shape power and leverage: In contexts where arms-production networks matter for political leverage, offsets are treated as tools to create interdependence. Mechanism: offset clauses create network ties; direct offsets can help technologically advanced states maintain central positions, while indirect offsets can lock less-capable states into peripheral roles. Outcome: shifts in network position/power and offsets pursued primarily for political leverage (with outcomes moderated by initial capability). (spindel_24_pdf__cmo_001, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_002, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_003, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_004)\nInterdependence and trust pathways (limited evidence): In contexts of coordinated procurement and cooperation, interdependence and socialisation are proposed as pathways to more cooperation/trust. Mechanism: coordinated responses create interdependence that drives greater cooperation; cooperation may strengthen trust via socialisation (framed with lower-confidence “other” evidence). Outcome: greater defence cooperation and strengthened trust. (kollias_25_pdf__cmo_002, weiss_19_pdf__cmo_003)\n\n\n\n\nAcross domains, the RQ1 CMOs imply that alliance-relevant effects hinge less on the existence of offsets/IP per se than on how they are structured and governed: (09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008, 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_003, 08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001)\n\nAbsorptive capacity and programme structure condition technology transfer: where institutional/human-capital capacity exists, transferred know-how is more plausibly internalised; where programmes embed staged localisation and learning-by-doing, technology absorption is framed as improving over time. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_003, 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_017, 15_the_role_of_offsets_in_indian_defense_procurement_policy_pdf__cmo_004)\nSustainment-focused designs more directly connect to readiness and security of supply: direct offsets and targeted cooperation aimed at maintenance/modification/MRO are repeatedly linked to readiness-relevant capabilities, whereas broad industrialisation goals are treated as diverging strategies. (10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_017, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_002, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_013)\nGovernance choices can mitigate or amplify distortion: rules that keep offsets secondary to military requirements/value-for-money are explicitly framed as anti-distortion safeguards; conversely, complex collaborative governance and non-competitive work splitting are linked to higher costs/delays. (09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008, 07_comparing_british_and_german_offset_strategies_pdf__cmo_003, 08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001)\nExport-control/technology-release constraints are binding moderators: where autonomy or interoperability requires sensitive technology release (e.g., software source code), outcomes depend on supplier willingness/ability and approval processes, which can reshape competition and feasible partnering. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_020, hagelin_12_pdf__cmo_002, 08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_006)\nScale and market viability constrain sustainment and export outcomes: small fleets and short support commitments are linked to high sustainment costs and weak export prospects, limiting any alliance-relevant benefits from domestic participation. (14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_010, 14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_007)\n\nThe CMOs also point to mixed/contested implications: interoperability can be supported by programme integration and standardisation, but is also framed as generating costly acceleration dynamics under budget and political pressures. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_004, 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_017)\n\n\n\n\nIn contexts where imported systems create sustainment dependence, offsets/IP may support readiness and faster operational contribution by building in-country maintenance/modification competence via direct military offsets or sustainment-centred cooperation. (10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_017, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_014)\nIn contexts where interoperability is prioritised, alliance outcomes may be supported through multinational programme structures (joint development/risk sharing) that integrate partners into common standards earlier, potentially reducing reliance on post-sale offsets. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_004, weiss_19_pdf__cmo_002)\nIn contexts where domestic absorptive capacity is strong (R&D institutions, trained personnel), offsets/IP may support security-of-supply-relevant autonomy by enabling technology absorption and domestic control over sustainment and evolution (including software). (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_003, 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_017)\nIn contexts where technology release is constrained (export controls, source-code restrictions), offsets/IP may fail to deliver autonomy/interoperability pathways; procurement may need to treat technology-access feasibility as a binding condition rather than an assumed benefit. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_020, hagelin_12_pdf__cmo_002)\nIn contexts where collaborative programmes rely on non-competitive work splitting and complex governance, alliance capability goals may be undermined by cost/delay and fragmentation; constraining offsets’ role in supplier selection is one stated guardrail. (08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001, 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008)\nIn contexts where political assurance or leverage is a primary objective, offsets/IP may function as alliance-management tools by creating interdependence and network ties; strategy should treat this as a distinct mechanism from capability/readiness outcomes. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_018, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_004)\nBoundary condition / risk of overreach: where domestic production is small-scale/non-competitive or offsets are met via indirect/investment channels that dilute defence linkage, intended readiness/autonomy gains may not materialise and opportunity costs may be high.

(11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_004, 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_001)\nDomestic prime leadership in co-development enabling higher-end capability: In contexts where the buyer maintains financial/budgetary leadership and a domestic prime role in program structure, technology transfers are embedded within a domestic-led production/integration effort. Mechanism: domestic prime authority + embedded transfers build manufacturing and integration capability while preserving export flexibility. Outcome: higher-end aerospace capability and export positioning. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_014)\nCapability erosion under offset-dependent participation: In contexts where industrial participation is mainly offset-dependent work (rather than substantive collaboration or independent programmes), design and systems-integration learning can be reduced. Mechanism: reliance on offset-dependent tasks reduces opportunities to build/retain high-end design and integration experience. Outcome: erosion of long-run national design/systems-integration capability. (08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_005)\n\n\n\n\n\nComplex governance and non-competitive work splitting increasing cost/delay: In contexts of collaborative procurement with juste-retour style work allocation and multi-layer governance, programmes become administratively heavy. Mechanism: non-competitive splitting and committee structures increase transaction costs, blur accountability, and slow decisions. Outcome: inefficiency, higher costs, and programme delays. (08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001)\nRelaxing strict work-share rules as an efficiency pathway (contingent): In contexts where collaborative procurement tensions exist around juste-retour vs alternative work-share approaches, shifting work-share rules is treated as a lever. Mechanism: moving from strict national shares toward “global balance” reduces fragmentation and can improve collaborative efficiency, but depends on political agreement and acceptance of perceived disadvantages. Outcome: improved efficiency / reduced fragmentation (conditional). (07_comparing_british_and_german_offset_strategies_pdf__cmo_009)\nConstraining offsets to reduce procurement distortion: In contexts where procurement must be driven by military requirements and value-for-money, offsets are explicitly constrained. Mechanism: prohibiting offsets from influencing supplier choice until requirements are met reduces distortion in capability selection. Outcome: offsets take a secondary role in procurement evaluation. (09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008, 07_comparing_british_and_german_offset_strategies_pdf__cmo_003)\nSteering supplier behaviour with eligibility criteria and multipliers (governance instrument): In contexts where offset programmes specify what “counts” and provide multipliers, suppliers are nudged toward higher-valued activities. Mechanism: eligibility rules and multipliers reshape incentives, increasing proposals for R&D/training and other preferred activities relative to low-value or relabelled work. Outcome: contractors focus on technology-intensive activities (as credited compliance behaviour). (18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_003)\nShift away from ill-focused offsets toward more specific provisions: In contexts where offsets are judged ill-focused, states replace broad offset approaches with narrower mechanisms. Mechanism: targeting sustainment-relevant capabilities and then substituting contract-specific provisions/local-content requirements aims to concentrate on self-reliance-relevant outcomes while reducing offset-related inefficiencies. Outcome: offsets abolished de facto and replaced by more specific contractual provisions. (18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_005)\n\n\n\n\n\nOffsets/IP as political assurance within alliance relationships: In contexts of tenuous security environments and high dependence on an external guarantor, offsets and arms sales can be valued for assurance effects. Mechanism: offset-inclusive purchases reinforce political/alliance-building signals, shaping decision-makers’ willingness to continue offset-inclusive procurement. Outcome: continued pursuit of offsets for political assurance alongside industrial benefits. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_018, 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_001)\nOffsets creating network ties that shape power and leverage: In contexts where arms-production networks matter for political leverage, offsets are treated as tools to create interdependence. Mechanism: offset clauses create network ties; direct offsets can help technologically advanced states maintain central positions, while indirect offsets can lock less-capable states into peripheral roles. Outcome: shifts in network position/power and offsets pursued primarily for political leverage (with outcomes moderated by initial capability). (spindel_24_pdf__cmo_001, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_002, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_003, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_004)\nInterdependence and trust pathways (limited evidence): In contexts of coordinated procurement and cooperation, interdependence and socialisation are proposed as pathways to more cooperation/trust. Mechanism: coordinated responses create interdependence that drives greater cooperation; cooperation may strengthen trust via socialisation (framed with lower-confidence “other” evidence). Outcome: greater defence cooperation and strengthened trust. (kollias_25_pdf__cmo_002, weiss_19_pdf__cmo_003)\n\n\n\n\nAcross domains, the RQ1 CMOs imply that alliance-relevant effects hinge less on the existence of offsets/IP per se than on how they are structured and governed: (09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008, 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_003, 08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001)\n\nAbsorptive capacity and programme structure condition technology transfer: where institutional/human-capital capacity exists, transferred know-how is more plausibly internalised; where programmes embed staged localisation and learning-by-doing, technology absorption is framed as improving over time. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_003, 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_017, 15_the_role_of_offsets_in_indian_defense_procurement_policy_pdf__cmo_004)\nSustainment-focused designs more directly connect to readiness and security of supply: direct offsets and targeted cooperation aimed at maintenance/modification/MRO are repeatedly linked to readiness-relevant capabilities, whereas broad industrialisation goals are treated as diverging strategies. (10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_017, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_002, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_013)\nGovernance choices can mitigate or amplify distortion: rules that keep offsets secondary to military requirements/value-for-money are explicitly framed as anti-distortion safeguards; conversely, complex collaborative governance and non-competitive work splitting are linked to higher costs/delays. (09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008, 07_comparing_british_and_german_offset_strategies_pdf__cmo_003, 08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001)\nExport-control/technology-release constraints are binding moderators: where autonomy or interoperability requires sensitive technology release (e.g., software source code), outcomes depend on supplier willingness/ability and approval processes, which can reshape competition and feasible partnering. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_020, hagelin_12_pdf__cmo_002, 08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_006)\nScale and market viability constrain sustainment and export outcomes: small fleets and short support commitments are linked to high sustainment costs and weak export prospects, limiting any alliance-relevant benefits from domestic participation. (14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_010, 14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_007)\n\nThe CMOs also point to mixed/contested implications: interoperability can be supported by programme integration and standardisation, but is also framed as generating costly acceleration dynamics under budget and political pressures. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_004, 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_017)\n\n\n\n\nIn contexts where imported systems create sustainment dependence, offsets/IP may support readiness and faster operational contribution by building in-country maintenance/modification competence via direct military offsets or sustainment-centred cooperation. (10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_017, 17_offsets_and_defense_industrialization_in_indonesia_and_singapore_pdf__cmo_014)\nIn contexts where interoperability is prioritised, alliance outcomes may be supported through multinational programme structures (joint development/risk sharing) that integrate partners into common standards earlier, potentially reducing reliance on post-sale offsets. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_004, weiss_19_pdf__cmo_002)\nIn contexts where domestic absorptive capacity is strong (R&D institutions, trained personnel), offsets/IP may support security-of-supply-relevant autonomy by enabling technology absorption and domestic control over sustainment and evolution (including software). (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_003, 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_017)\nIn contexts where technology release is constrained (export controls, source-code restrictions), offsets/IP may fail to deliver autonomy/interoperability pathways; procurement may need to treat technology-access feasibility as a binding condition rather than an assumed benefit. (13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_020, hagelin_12_pdf__cmo_002)\nIn contexts where collaborative programmes rely on non-competitive work splitting and complex governance, alliance capability goals may be undermined by cost/delay and fragmentation; constraining offsets’ role in supplier selection is one stated guardrail. (08_offsets_and_the_joint_strike_fighter_in_the_uk_and_the_netherlands_pdf__cmo_001, 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_008)\nIn contexts where political assurance or leverage is a primary objective, offsets/IP may function as alliance-management tools by creating interdependence and network ties; strategy should treat this as a distinct mechanism from capability/readiness outcomes. (16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_018, spindel_24_pdf__cmo_004)\nBoundary condition / risk of overreach: where domestic production is small-scale/non-competitive or offsets are met via indirect/investment channels that dilute defence linkage, intended readiness/autonomy gains may not materialise and opportunity costs may be high. (14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_002, 19_defense_industrial_participation_the_south_african_experience_pdf__cmo_008, 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_020)"

Your task is to infer per-theme “demi-regularities”: conditional C→M→O tendencies that explain when/how a mechanism theme tends to produce particular outcomes.\nYou are not doing statistics. You are producing defensible, evidence-traceable pattern statements grounded ONLY in the provided extracted CMO records.\nINPUTS You will receive:\n\nproto_themes_yml\n\n\nLoaded from: data/mechanism_themes/proto_themes.yml\nContains: proto_mechanism_themes[].theme_id, theme_label, mechanism_explanation, mechanisms[].id\nIMPORTANT: mechanisms[].id values are CMO identifiers (a.k.a. chunk_id) that must be found in the CMO YAML bundle below.\n\n\ncmo_statements.csv\n\n\nLoaded from data/cmo_statements.csv\nA CSV with CMO statments and the following relevant columns: file_id chunk_id context_statement mechanism_statement outcome_statement confidence (low|medium|high) confidence_justification evidence_paraphrase (supporting evidence paraphrased) evidence_quote (supporting evidence quote)\n\nDEFINITIONS (MUST APPLY) - Context (C): salient conditions that shape whether/how the mechanism fires (settings, constraints, incentives, capacities). Not a program activity. - Mechanism (M): the generative causal process (resources/constraints + actors’ reasoning/response → causal force). Not an activity or policy label. - Outcome (O): observed/reported effect(s), intended or unintended. Not an activity or plan. - Demi-regularity: a recurring tendency (not a universal law) stated conditionally: “In contexts where X, mechanism Z tends to yield Y…”, including boundary conditions and counterexamples.\nTASK For EACH proto-mechanism theme:\nStep 1 — Assemble the evidence set - Collect the set of CMO records whose chunk_id matches the theme’s mechanisms[].id. - If any mechanisms[].id cannot be found in cmo_yml_bundle, list them under missing_cmo_ids for that theme (do not guess).\nStep 2 — Characterize what varies and what repeats - Summarize the recurring context conditions (paraphrase context text). - Summarize recurring outcome tendencies (paraphrase outcome text). - Identify meaningful within-theme variation: - outcomes that differ for similar contexts - contexts that appear to strengthen, weaken, or reverse the tendency - cases that look like “failures to fire” (mechanism present but outcome absent or opposite)\nStep 3 — Write demi-regularity statements - Produce 2–6 demi-regularities per theme (fewer if evidence is thin). - Each statement MUST be of the form: “In contexts where [X], [MECHANISM THEME LOGIC] tends to yield [Y].” - Keep [X] and [Y] specific enough to be meaningful, but general enough to cover multiple CMO records. - Tie the mechanism phrasing to the theme_label/mechanism_explanation; do not invent a new mechanism unrelated to the theme.\nStep 4 — Add moderators and boundary conditions - For each demi-regularity, specify: - moderators: conditions that strengthen/weaken the tendency - boundary_conditions: conditions under which the tendency is unlikely to hold - counterexamples: CMO IDs that do not fit the tendency, and what differs about them - Only claim a moderator/boundary condition if you can point to at least one supporting CMO ID.\nStep 5 — Evidence traceability and confidence - Every demi-regularity MUST include supporting_cmo_ids (chunk_id list). - Where possible, include 1–2 short “anchor quotes” drawn from supporting_evidence fields of the linked CMOs (do not exceed ~25 words per quote). - Provide confidence per demi-regularity (low|medium|high) based on: - number and diversity of supporting CMOs - internal consistency (few/clear counterexamples vs many/unclear) - source confidence ratings (if provided) and evidence_type (if present) - If evidence is mainly theory_model or otherwise non-empirical, reflect that in confidence_justification (do not dismiss it; just be explicit).\nIMPORTANT RULES - Do not invent facts beyond the provided CMO records. - Do not “average away” contradictions: surface them as moderators/counterexamples. - Prefer concise, realist-style causal phrasing over narrative prose. - Keep chunk_id values EXACT; do not edit or shorten them.\nOUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT YAML ONLY) Output valid YAML only (no markdown, no commentary).\nSchema: demi_regularities_by_theme: - theme_id: PM1 theme_label: “…” mechanism_explanation: “…” cmo_ids_in_theme: [chunk_id_1, chunk_id_2] missing_cmo_ids: [chunk_id_x] demi_regularities: - demi_regularity_id: “PM1_DR_01” statement: “In contexts where …, … tends to yield ….” context_conditions: - “…” outcome_tendencies: - “…” supporting_cmo_ids: [chunk_id_1, chunk_id_2] anchor_quotes: - cmo_id: chunk_id_1 quote: “…” moderators: - condition: “…” effect: “strengthens” | “weakens” | “reverses” | “enables” | “inhibits” supporting_cmo_ids: [chunk_id_2] boundary_conditions: - condition: “…” supporting_cmo_ids: [chunk_id_3] counterexamples: - cmo_id: chunk_id_4 note: “Does not fit because …” confidence: low | medium | high confidence_justification: “…” theme_notes: - “1–3 bullets on coverage/gaps and what to look for next.”\nYAML CHECKLIST - Output YAML only. - Use spaces for indentation (2 spaces). - Quote strings containing punctuation. - Ensure every list item starts with “-”.\nNOW DO THE PATTERNING FOR THE PROVIDED INPUTS AND OUTPUT ONLY YAML."

Move it to ambiguous_mechanisms and list the likely theme IDs in possible_themes.\n\nDECISION RULES (STRICT)\n\nUse generative process similarity, not:\n\nshared outcomes\nshared country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the

mechanism_explanation: Presenting offsets as economic benefits or conditional support shifts decision-makers’ and publics’\n    cost-benefit reasoning, making purchases more politically acceptable.\n  mechanisms:\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: By offering cost offsets framed as economic benefits, sellers provide an inducement that shifts decision-makers’\n      reasoning from reluctance to acceptance.\n    rationale: Frames offsets as economic benefits that shift decision-makers toward acceptance.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_002\n    text: By embedding compensatory work in an offset package, officials can present support to domestic producers as a condition\n      of purchase rather than a visible subsidy, reducing political costs.\n    rationale: Uses offset packaging to present support as a purchase condition, lowering political exposure.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: By making offsets appear to deliver large economic benefits (even if illusory), officials reduce perceived net costs\n      and increase public acceptance.\n    rationale: Emphasises perceived benefits to reduce net-cost perceptions and build public acceptance.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_021\n    text: Promised offset benefits provide an argument that reframes the purchase as economically beneficial, reducing resistance.\n    rationale: Reframes the purchase as economically beneficial to reduce resistance.\n  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because expected benefits are more salient than expected costs, officials adopt offsets even when net welfare effects\n      are ambiguous.\n    rationale: Benefit salience drives adoption despite ambiguous net welfare.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Buyer ability to extract economic activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to import superior foreign\n      systems, reinforcing exporter dominance while forcing work-sharing back to buyer countries.\n    rationale: Ability to extract activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to buy foreign systems.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Politicians use offset promises as persuasive rhetoric to frame weapons purchases as delivering wider economic development\n      benefits.\n    rationale: Offset promises frame purchases as economic development, increasing acceptability.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: By creating concentrated local benefits for the military, politicians, and firms, offsets generate supportive coalitions\n      that reduce political resistance to procurement.\n    rationale: Concentrated local benefits build supportive coalitions that reduce political resistance.\n  - id: 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: By offering offsets (including technology transfer and production arrangements) as inducements in defense sales,\n      the US reinforces alliance ties and supports interoperability and extended production.\n    rationale: Offsets as inducements in sales reinforce alliances and interoperability, increasing acceptance.\n  - id: 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_018\n    text: Offsets and arms sales reinforce political and alliance-building signals, which Taiwan values as assurance of ongoing\n      US security commitment.\n    rationale: Offsets and arms sales signal alliance commitment and assurance.\n  - id: 19_defense_industrial_participation_the_south_african_experience_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Officials emphasized offsets as promised economic benefits to shift public and political reasoning toward acceptance\n      of the arms purchase.\n    rationale: Offsets framed as promised benefits shift public/political acceptance.\n  - id: 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Promoters emphasize job creation and investment narratives to legitimize offsets as development tools, even as the\n      job-creation emphasis later weakens.\n    rationale: Job-creation narratives legitimate offsets as development tools.\n  - id: 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_017\n    text: Promised regional industrial participation benefits (e.g., Ferrostaal steel projects) can act as decisive inducements\n      in selecting higher-priced bids.\n    rationale: Promised regional benefits act as inducements in bid selection.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Arms sales paired with technology-transfer offsets build local capacity and simultaneously serve as a tool to reinforce\n      diplomatic and military ties.\n    rationale: Transfers build local capacity while reinforcing diplomatic/military ties.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Offsets are used to redirect some procurement-related value toward domestic industrial/technological upgrading and\n      to improve political acceptability; purchasers may pay a premium to place work locally.\n    rationale: Offsets redirect value to domestic upgrading and improve political acceptability.\n- theme_id: PM2\n  theme_label: Compliance shaped by incentives and monitoring\n  mechanism_explanation: 'Delivery depends on the enforcement regime: transparency and credible incentives/penalties encourage\n    compliance, while weak oversight and accounting games reduce real fulfilment.'\n  mechanisms:\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_004\n    text: Shifts in conditions, contractor fortunes, or bad faith reduce the ability and incentives to complete promised offset\n      activities, especially when enforcement is weak.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement and changing conditions reduce incentives and capacity to fulfil obligations.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Structuring offset agreements to maximize transparency and create credible incentives/penalties increases supplier\n      compliance with offset obligations.\n    rationale: Transparency plus credible incentives/penalties raise compliance with obligations.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery\n      without creating genuinely additional business.\n    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement\n      is difficult in practice.\n    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement\n      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.\n    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.\n  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019\n    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,\n      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.\n    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008\n    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment\n      value.\n    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016\n    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement\n      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids provides an informal enforcement incentive to meet offset targets.\n    rationale: Informal threat of future bid exclusion incentivizes compliance.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Multipliers and penalty-backed obligations increase incentives for investment and technology transfer into pre-determined\n      local sectors.\n    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated\n      and accountability weakens.\n    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce\n      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.\n    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Reducing multipliers or evaluating them case-by-case limits artificial inflation of offset value and shifts emphasis\n      to verifiable projects.\n    rationale: Reducing multipliers or reviewing them case-by-case limits inflated credit values.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Restricting banking (time limits, transfer limits, caps on proportion satisfied) preserves closer coupling between\n      current procurement and compensatory activity.\n    rationale: Restricting banking preserves coupling between procurement and compensatory activity.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_007\n    text: Denmark avoids financial penalties because it acknowledges penalties raise import prices, instead using supplier\n      blacklisting; Norway uses withheld-payment sanctions; Finland/Sweden accept economic sanctions.\n    rationale: Sanctions/blacklisting create enforcement incentives without necessarily raising prices via penalties.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Complex and heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentage values from actual work delivered, complicating\n      audits and comparisons.\n    rationale: Complex arrangements decouple headline percentages from real delivery, complicating audits.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Because supplier contribution to deal initiation cannot be established and some projects would have occurred anyway,\n      fulfillment rates can be inflated by multiplier pricing, consultants, and advance crediting.\n    rationale: Multipliers and advance crediting inflate fulfillment where projects would occur anyway.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Lack of clear requirements and approval criteria enables retroactive crediting and preferential treatment, reducing\n      competition and potentially raising prices.\n    rationale: Vague criteria enable retroactive crediting and preferential treatment, undermining competition.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Making policy more specific, setting approval criteria in advance, and requiring competitive bidding and continuous\n      monitoring improves transparency and limits distortions.\n    rationale: Clear criteria, competitive bidding, and monitoring improve transparency and reduce distortions.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because additionality is difficult to measure and work may be re-labeled or low quality, credited projects do not\n      reliably represent new economic activity.\n    rationale: Relabeling or low-quality work undermines additionality and accountability.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Through pre-compensations (offset banking credits), suppliers count normal trade flows as offsets against future\n      obligations.\n    rationale: Pre-compensation credits allow normal trade to count against future obligations.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: By applying multipliers (including exceptionally high ones), policymakers can inflate credited offset value beyond\n      underlying transaction costs, enabling “headline” offset totals.\n    rationale: High multipliers inflate credited offset value beyond underlying transactions.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Non-terminable agreements and liquidated damages (up to 100% of outstanding obligations) raise expected costs of\n      non-compliance and are intended to enforce delivery.\n    rationale: Strong penalties and non-terminable agreements raise non-compliance costs to enforce delivery.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_009\n    text: Parallel bargaining and the option to specify projects allow the buyer to attempt to reduce ambiguity and lock suppliers\n      into concrete deliverables.\n    rationale: Parallel bargaining and project specification reduce ambiguity and lock suppliers into deliverables.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Because credited value is set to reflect value to the economy rather than actual provision costs, administrative\n      crediting can decouple “credit” from real effort.\n    rationale: Administrative crediting can decouple value credited from real effort.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Multipliers and differing valuation conventions enable large gaps between “nominal,” “net,” and “gross” reported\n      offset values, complicating verification.\n    rationale: Multipliers and valuation conventions create large gaps between nominal and net values.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: By insisting on specific offset projects and obligations rather than an open agreement, Poland attempts to lock\n      in hard commitments and reduce supplier discretion.\n    rationale: Specific projects and obligations reduce supplier discretion and lock in commitments.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_015\n    text: Low liquidated-damages rates reduce the expected cost of non-performance, making it rational for a supplier to pay\n      penalties instead of fully discharging obligations in some cases.\n    rationale: Low liquidated damages lower expected non-performance costs, enabling strategic non-compliance.\n  - id: 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_018\n    text: Multipliers raise credited value for higher-priority activities (technology transfer, training, licensing/copro)\n      and thereby steer supplier effort toward capability-building deliverables.\n    rationale: Multipliers steer effort toward capability-building deliverables by inflating credit values.\n  - id: 14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: A knowledgeable negotiating team can secure more favorable, capability-relevant terms and reduce asymmetric-information\n

16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: The threat of banning contractors from future competitions increases incentives to fulfill offset obligations.\n    rationale: Future-ban threats increase incentives to fulfill obligations.\n  - id: 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Mandating offset obligations and tracking acquittals creates stronger compliance incentives and clearer reporting,\n      even though compliance may not equal net benefit.\n    rationale: Mandated obligations and tracking strengthen compliance incentives and reporting.\n  - id: 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Eligibility criteria plus multipliers steer suppliers toward higher-valued activities (e.g., R&D and training) by\n      making them “count” more toward obligations.\n    rationale: Eligibility criteria and multipliers steer suppliers toward higher-valued activities.\n  - id: 18_defense_offsets_in_australia_and_new_zealand_pdf__cmo_004\n    text: Project Deeds, Credit Deeds, and liquidated damages create enforceable commitments and rewards for longer-term programs,\n

country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new

run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the

Move it to ambiguous_mechanisms and list the likely theme IDs in possible_themes.\n\nDECISION RULES (STRICT)\n\nUse generative process similarity, not:\n\nshared outcomes\nshared country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the current max - theme_id: the destination theme ID (or AMBIGUOUS) - mechanism_id - summary: 1 sentence describing what changed (include from/to theme IDs) - rationale: 1–2 sentences justifying the

mechanism_explanation: Presenting offsets as economic benefits or conditional support shifts decision-makers’ and publics’\n    cost-benefit reasoning, making purchases more politically acceptable.\n  mechanisms:\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: By offering cost offsets framed as economic benefits, sellers provide an inducement that shifts decision-makers’\n      reasoning from reluctance to acceptance.\n    rationale: Frames offsets as economic benefits that shift decision-makers toward acceptance.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_002\n    text: By embedding compensatory work in an offset package, officials can present support to domestic producers as a condition\n      of purchase rather than a visible subsidy, reducing political costs.\n    rationale: Uses offset packaging to present support as a purchase condition, lowering political exposure.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: By making offsets appear to deliver large economic benefits (even if illusory), officials reduce perceived net costs\n      and increase public acceptance.\n    rationale: Emphasises perceived benefits to reduce net-cost perceptions and build public acceptance.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_021\n    text: Promised offset benefits provide an argument that reframes the purchase as economically beneficial, reducing resistance.\n    rationale: Reframes the purchase as economically beneficial to reduce resistance.\n  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because expected benefits are more salient than expected costs, officials adopt offsets even when net welfare effects\n      are ambiguous.\n    rationale: Benefit salience drives adoption despite ambiguous net welfare.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Buyer ability to extract economic activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to import superior foreign\n      systems, reinforcing exporter dominance while forcing work-sharing back to buyer countries.\n    rationale: Ability to extract activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to buy foreign systems.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Politicians use offset promises as persuasive rhetoric to frame weapons purchases as delivering wider economic development\n      benefits.\n    rationale: Offset promises frame purchases as economic development, increasing acceptability.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: By creating concentrated local benefits for the military, politicians, and firms, offsets generate supportive coalitions\n      that reduce political resistance to procurement.\n    rationale: Concentrated local benefits build supportive coalitions that reduce political resistance.\n  - id: 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: By offering offsets (including technology transfer and production arrangements) as inducements in defense sales,\n      the US reinforces alliance ties and supports interoperability and extended production.\n    rationale: Offsets as inducements in sales reinforce alliances and interoperability, increasing acceptance.\n  - id: 16_offset_policies_and_trends_in_japan_south_korea_and_taiwan_pdf__cmo_018\n    text: Offsets and arms sales reinforce political and alliance-building signals, which Taiwan values as assurance of ongoing\n      US security commitment.\n    rationale: Offsets and arms sales signal alliance commitment and assurance.\n  - id: 19_defense_industrial_participation_the_south_african_experience_pdf__cmo_001\n    text: Officials emphasized offsets as promised economic benefits to shift public and political reasoning toward acceptance\n      of the arms purchase.\n    rationale: Offsets framed as promised benefits shift public/political acceptance.\n  - id: 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Promoters emphasize job creation and investment narratives to legitimize offsets as development tools, even as the\n      job-creation emphasis later weakens.\n    rationale: Job-creation narratives legitimate offsets as development tools.\n  - id: 20_defense_offsets_and_regional_development_in_south_africa_pdf__cmo_017\n    text: Promised regional industrial participation benefits (e.g., Ferrostaal steel projects) can act as decisive inducements\n      in selecting higher-priced bids.\n    rationale: Promised regional benefits act as inducements in bid selection.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Arms sales paired with technology-transfer offsets build local capacity and simultaneously serve as a tool to reinforce\n      diplomatic and military ties.\n    rationale: Transfers build local capacity while reinforcing diplomatic/military ties.\n  - id: 01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Offsets are used to redirect some procurement-related value toward domestic industrial/technological upgrading and\n      to improve political acceptability; purchasers may pay a premium to place work locally.\n    rationale: Offsets redirect value to domestic upgrading and improve political acceptability.\n- theme_id: PM2\n  theme_label: Compliance shaped by incentives and monitoring\n  mechanism_explanation: 'Delivery depends on the enforcement regime: transparency and credible incentives/penalties encourage\n    compliance, while weak oversight and accounting games reduce real fulfilment.'\n  mechanisms:\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_004\n    text: Shifts in conditions, contractor fortunes, or bad faith reduce the ability and incentives to complete promised offset\n      activities, especially when enforcement is weak.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement and changing conditions reduce incentives and capacity to fulfil obligations.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Structuring offset agreements to maximize transparency and create credible incentives/penalties increases supplier\n      compliance with offset obligations.\n    rationale: Transparency plus credible incentives/penalties raise compliance with obligations.\n  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery\n      without creating genuinely additional business.\n    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement\n      is difficult in practice.\n    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.\n  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement\n      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.\n    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.\n  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019\n    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,\n      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.\n    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008\n    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment\n      value.\n    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.\n  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016\n    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement\n      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.\n    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids provides an informal enforcement incentive to meet offset targets.\n    rationale: Informal threat of future bid exclusion incentivizes compliance.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Multipliers and penalty-backed obligations increase incentives for investment and technology transfer into pre-determined\n      local sectors.\n    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated\n      and accountability weakens.\n    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.\n  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce\n      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.\n    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: Reducing multipliers or evaluating them case-by-case limits artificial inflation of offset value and shifts emphasis\n      to verifiable projects.\n    rationale: Reducing multipliers or reviewing them case-by-case limits inflated credit values.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Restricting banking (time limits, transfer limits, caps on proportion satisfied) preserves closer coupling between\n      current procurement and compensatory activity.\n    rationale: Restricting banking preserves coupling between procurement and compensatory activity.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_007\n    text: Denmark avoids financial penalties because it acknowledges penalties raise import prices, instead using supplier\n      blacklisting; Norway uses withheld-payment sanctions; Finland/Sweden accept economic sanctions.\n    rationale: Sanctions/blacklisting create enforcement incentives without necessarily raising prices via penalties.\n  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_011\n    text: Complex and heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentage values from actual work delivered, complicating\n      audits and comparisons.\n    rationale: Complex arrangements decouple headline percentages from real delivery, complicating audits.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Because supplier contribution to deal initiation cannot be established and some projects would have occurred anyway,\n      fulfillment rates can be inflated by multiplier pricing, consultants, and advance crediting.\n    rationale: Multipliers and advance crediting inflate fulfillment where projects would occur anyway.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: Lack of clear requirements and approval criteria enables retroactive crediting and preferential treatment, reducing\n      competition and potentially raising prices.\n    rationale: Vague criteria enable retroactive crediting and preferential treatment, undermining competition.\n  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_014\n    text: Making policy more specific, setting approval criteria in advance, and requiring competitive bidding and continuous\n      monitoring improves transparency and limits distortions.\n    rationale: Clear criteria, competitive bidding, and monitoring improve transparency and reduce distortions.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_003\n    text: Because additionality is difficult to measure and work may be re-labeled or low quality, credited projects do not\n      reliably represent new economic activity.\n    rationale: Relabeling or low-quality work undermines additionality and accountability.\n  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Through pre-compensations (offset banking credits), suppliers count normal trade flows as offsets against future\n      obligations.\n    rationale: Pre-compensation credits allow normal trade to count against future obligations.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_005\n    text: By applying multipliers (including exceptionally high ones), policymakers can inflate credited offset value beyond\n      underlying transaction costs, enabling “headline” offset totals.\n    rationale: High multipliers inflate credited offset value beyond underlying transactions.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_006\n    text: Non-terminable agreements and liquidated damages (up to 100% of outstanding obligations) raise expected costs of\n      non-compliance and are intended to enforce delivery.\n    rationale: Strong penalties and non-terminable agreements raise non-compliance costs to enforce delivery.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_009\n    text: Parallel bargaining and the option to specify projects allow the buyer to attempt to reduce ambiguity and lock suppliers\n      into concrete deliverables.\n    rationale: Parallel bargaining and project specification reduce ambiguity and lock suppliers into deliverables.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_010\n    text: Because credited value is set to reflect value to the economy rather than actual provision costs, administrative\n      crediting can decouple “credit” from real effort.\n    rationale: Administrative crediting can decouple value credited from real effort.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: Multipliers and differing valuation conventions enable large gaps between “nominal,” “net,” and “gross” reported\n      offset values, complicating verification.\n    rationale: Multipliers and valuation conventions create large gaps between nominal and net values.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_013\n    text: By insisting on specific offset projects and obligations rather than an open agreement, Poland attempts to lock\n      in hard commitments and reduce supplier discretion.\n    rationale: Specific projects and obligations reduce supplier discretion and lock in commitments.\n  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_015\n    text: Low liquidated-damages rates reduce the expected cost of non-performance, making it rational for a supplier to pay\n      penalties instead of fully discharging obligations in some cases.\n    rationale: Low liquidated damages lower expected non-performance costs, enabling strategic non-compliance.\n  - id: 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_018\n    text: Multipliers raise credited value for higher-priority activities (technology transfer, training, licensing/copro)\n      and thereby steer supplier effort toward capability-building deliverables.\n    rationale: Multipliers steer effort toward capability-building deliverables by inflating credit values.\n  - id: 14_the_argentine_defense_industry_an_evaluation_pdf__cmo_012\n    text: A knowledgeable negotiating team can secure more favorable, capability-relevant terms and reduce asymmetric-information\n

country/programme\nshared sector / platform\nsurface keywords\n\n“Better fit” means: another theme’s explanation more directly states the causal process described in the mechanism.\nDo not create new themes in this task.\n\nEDITING RULES (STRICT)\n\nDo not change any mechanism id or text.\nYou MAY update rationale when a mechanism is kept or moved, but keep it short and specific to why it fits that theme.\nEnsure each mechanism appears exactly once across:\n\nall themes’ mechanisms lists, OR\nambiguous_mechanisms\n\nOnly move mechanisms that were originally in the target theme for this run.\n\nDo not “clean up” other themes unless needed to avoid duplicates created by your move.\n\n\nCHANGE LOGGING (UPDATE EXISTING YAML CHANGE LOG)\nThe change log file contains a history of many kinds of theme edits (e.g., new_theme, merge, no_change, assignment).\nYou MUST preserve all existing entries exactly as they are, and append new entry/entries for every change you make in this run:\n\nIf moved theme-to-theme: change_type: assignment\nIf moved to ambiguous: change_type: ambiguous\n\nEach entry must include: - change_id: next sequential ID (CHG_###), continuing from the
