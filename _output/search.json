    "text": "You are extracting realist-style Context–Mechanism–Outcome (CMO) configurations from ONE document at a time.\nDEFINITIONS (MUST APPLY) - Context (C): The salient conditions that shape whether/how the mechanism fires (e.g., institutional rules, alliance relationships, procurement regime, industrial base maturity, governance capacity, threat environment). - Mechanism (M): The underlying generative causal process that produces change, typically framed as: (programme resources/constraints) + (actors’ reasoning/response) -&gt; causal force Mechanisms are NOT the same as activities, outputs, or policies (avoid “setting up an office”, “signing an MoU” as mechanisms). - Outcome (O): The observed (or credibly reported) effect(s), intended or unintended (e.g., interoperability, security of supply, cost/schedule impacts, corruption risk, industrial capability, alliance integration).\nTASK 1) Read document_text carefully. 2) Identify and extract ALL defensible CMO configurations evidenced in the document. - Prefer “small” CMOs anchored to a specific claim/passage. - Do not stop at the first CMO; include additional distinct CMOs if the text supports them. - If the document only implies a CMO, you may still extract it but set confidence to low and make the inference explicit in the paraphrase. 3) Write each C, M, and O concisely (ideally 1–3 sentences each). 4) Create candidate tags in snake_case: - context_tags: 1–4 - mechanism_tags: 1–4 - outcome_tags: 1–4 5) Populate metadata fields: - programme: name of the programme linked to the offset deal (snake_case). If not stated, use unknown_programme (do NOT guess). - country: snake_case country name; use multi_country if needed; if not stated, use unknown_country. - research_questions_mapped: list of RQ IDs from the list below (e.g., [rq1, rq3]) - evidence_type: one of case_study | comparative_case_study | theory_model | legal_analysis | policy_report | survey_experiment | systematic_review | qualitative_interviews | mixed_methods | other - evidence_type_narrative: 1–2 sentences describing what kind of material this is and why you chose evidence_type. - supporting_evidence: a SHORT direct quote (max ~25 words) that supports the CMO. Use double quotes inside YAML; escape internal quotes. If no suitable short quote exists, use “” and rely on paraphrase. - supporting_evidence_paraphrase: 1–2 sentences paraphrasing the supporting passage and how it supports the CMO (may note if inference is being made). - confidence: low | medium | high based on how directly the text supports the CMO. - confidence_justification: 1–2 sentences explaining the confidence rating (e.g., direct explicit CMO vs partial/implicit, specificity of evidence).\nVALIDATION AND VERIFICATION (V&V) REQUIREMENTS - Validate each CMO against the source text: - supporting_evidence must directly support the CMO; if not, lower confidence and say so in the paraphrase. - If the CMO is inferred, explicitly state that in the paraphrase and set confidence to low. - Ensure mechanism is a causal process (not just an activity or policy). - Ensure outcomes are effects (observed or credibly reported) and do not overclaim beyond the text. - Ensure all tags, programme, and country values are snake_case. - Produce a V&V log summarizing checks, issues, and any adjustments.\nOUTPUT RULES (MUST FOLLOW) - Output ONLY valid YAML (no markdown, no commentary). - The YAML top level MUST be a mapping keyed by the FILE NAME exactly as given in file_name. - Under the file key, include ONLY: - cmos: a mapping from unique CMO IDs to CMO objects - v_and_v_log: a list of V&V entries (may be empty) - If you find no defensible CMO, output: : cmos: {} v_and_v_log: - check: no_defensible_cmo status: pass note: “No defensible CMO found in this document.” - Each CMO ID MUST be derived from the file name: a) Create file_slug by: - lowercasing - replacing all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores - collapsing multiple underscores to one - trimming leading/trailing underscores b) Append __cmo_### where ### is a zero-padded 3-digit index starting at 001. - Each CMO object MUST have exactly these keys (and in this order): context mechanism outcome context_tags mechanism_tags outcome_tags programme country evidence_type evidence_type_narrative research_questions_mapped supporting_evidence supporting_evidence_paraphrase confidence confidence_justification - All tags and programme/country values MUST be snake_case. - Lists MUST be valid YAML lists (use hyphens). - Avoid long quotations; do not invent facts not supported by the text.\nV&V LOG FORMAT - Each v_and_v_log entry MUST have exactly these keys: check status note - status must be one of: pass | warn | fail - Include at least these checks per file: - completeness_all_relevant_cmos - evidence_traceability - mechanism_is_causal - outcome_is_effect - snake_case_fields - quote_length - inference_flagged\nRESEARCH QUESTIONS (choose any that fit; can assign multiple per CMO) - rq1: Alliance relevance and mechanisms — Through what mechanisms do offset or industrial participation policies affect alliance-relevant outcomes such as interoperability, standardisation, security of supply, readiness, and the ability to contribute rapidly to NATO operations? - rq2: Conditions for durable collaboration — Under what conditions do offsets lead to durable industrial collaboration with allies and close partners (co-development, co-production, licensed production, shared sustainment/MRO, trusted supply chains)? - rq3: Risks and mitigation — What partnership risks are most commonly associated with offsets (corruption vulnerability, export-control friction, programme fragmentation, market distortion, cost/schedule impacts), and what mitigations/governance designs reduce these risks? - rq4: Positive comparative cases — Which countries combine continuing offset/industrial participation policy with high allied programme integration, and what design features enable coexistence? - rq5: Negative or mixed comparative cases — Which countries exhibit offset-related frictions that undermine partnership/alliance integration outcomes, and what policy design features appear implicated?\nNOW DO THE EXTRACTION FOR THE PROVIDED INPUTS AND OUTPUT ONLY YAML."
