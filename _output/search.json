    "text": "How can an offset policy support a NATO first strategic priority?\nHow can offsets support strong international partnerships and industrial collaboration with strategic partners?\nWhat risks do offsets present for enabling strategic partnerships?\nAre there any countries that demonstrate strong industrial collaboration with strategic partners whilst having an offset policy?\nAre there any countries that have struggled to develop strategic partnerships as a result of an offset policy?\n\n\n\nThe five research questions are well chosen for the policy problem you are trying to solve: they focus on the tension between national industrial participation goals (offsets) and the demands of alliance-centred defence planning (interoperability, readiness, and trusted industrial collaboration). They also sensibly include both “what can work” and “what can go wrong”, which helps avoid a one-sided evidence base. That said, the questions are currently framed at a high level and use terms that are intuitive in policy debate but unevenly used in the research literature. Phrases such as “NATO-aligned”, “strategic partners”, “strong partnerships”, and “hindered integration” are rarely stated explicitly in academic titles or abstracts, and can be interpreted in very different ways. If the questions remain this broad and value-laden, the review risks pulling in a wide range of material that is hard to compare, while still missing key studies simply because they use different language (for example, “industrial cooperation”, “industrial participation”, “industrial and regional benefits”, “workshare”, or “local content” rather than “offsets”).\nA second issue is that several questions imply cause-and-effect—offsets “support” or “hinder” partnerships—without clearly defining what counts as support or hindrance. In practice, much of the available evidence is descriptive, legal, or case-based and may only show associations or reported frictions, not clear causal impacts. Without more specific outcomes, it becomes difficult to draw defensible conclusions beyond general statements. “Strong partnership” could mean many things: smooth access to technology, programme participation, shared sustainment arrangements, stable export relationships, or political trust. Likewise, “alliance integration” could refer to operational interoperability, standardisation, procurement integration, or wider political alignment. These are not interchangeable. A rapid evidence synthesis will be stronger if it focuses on observable indicators (for example: co-development/co-production arrangements, supply-chain integration, shared maintenance and sustainment, adoption of common standards, documented procurement delays or supplier withdrawals, export-control deadlocks, or corruption investigations linked to offset activity).\nThe comparative “case” questions are the most promising, but they also need clearer criteria. Asking whether there are countries that combine offsets with strong strategic collaboration is a good way to ground the review in real-world experience. However, unless “strong industrial collaboration” is defined, the output can easily become a loose list of countries rather than an evidence-backed comparison. Collaboration can range from minor subcontracting through to licensed production, joint ventures, co-development, and shared sustainment—each with very different implications for sovereignty, security of supply, and interoperability. Similarly, “retaining an offset policy” could mean a formal mandatory regime, a voluntary industrial participation approach, or simply negotiated workshare expectations. Being explicit about what types of offset policy and what depth of collaboration you are looking for will make the case mapping more credible and repeatable.\nTo strengthen the review, the questions should be reframed slightly so they are easier to “find” in the literature and easier to answer with available evidence. A practical way to do this is to shift the emphasis from broad claims (“offsets support NATO alignment”) to mechanisms and conditions (“under what conditions and through what mechanisms do industrial participation requirements help or hinder alliance-relevant outcomes?”). That retains your policy intent but gives the review a clearer structure: what is the mechanism (technology transfer, local production, supply-chain diversification, governance design), what is the context (mandatory vs voluntary, direct vs indirect offsets, export-control environment, multinational programme setting), and what is the outcome (interoperability, timeliness, trust, cost, or corruption risk). This also makes it easier to handle contested evidence: where studies disagree, you can explain how different contexts or policy designs may account for different outcomes rather than forcing a single verdict.\nFinally, there is a retrieval and bias risk that is worth flagging upfront in your report. If the search strategy requires papers to mention “alliance” or “partnership” alongside “offsets,” it will miss a lot of relevant material, because many offset studies talk about industrial policy, technology transfer, and governance without using alliance language. Conversely, alliance interoperability literatures often discuss procurement and industrial cooperation without using the term “offset”. The recommendation is to use a two-stage approach: first retrieve the broader offset/industrial participation evidence and the industrial cooperation evidence separately (including synonyms), then screen and tag it against your NATO-first operational concept. This is more realistic for a rapid synthesis and reduces the chance that “no results” is mistaken for “no evidence”.\nOverall, the recommended refinements are modest but important: define key terms in plain operational language; specify a short set of measurable outcomes; treat “support” and “hindrance” as mechanisms and conditions rather than assumed effects; and use a case selection rubric so the positive and negative examples are comparable. These changes will make the evidence synthesis easier to execute, more transparent to readers, and more useful for decisions about whether (and how) an offset policy could be compatible with a NATO-first defence posture.\n\n\n\n\nAlliance relevance and mechanisms Through what mechanisms do offset or industrial participation policies affect alliance-relevant outcomes such as interoperability, standardisation, security of supply, readiness, and the ability to contribute rapidly to NATO operations?\nConditions for durable collaboration Under what conditions do offsets lead to durable industrial collaboration with allies and close partners—such as co-development, co-production, licensed production, shared sustainment/MRO, or integration into trusted supply chains?\nRisks and mitigation What partnership risks are most commonly associated with offsets (e.g., corruption vulnerability, export-control friction, programme fragmentation, market distortion, cost/schedule impacts), and what mitigation measures or governance designs are reported to reduce these risks?\nPositive comparative cases Which countries combine (a) a continuing offset/industrial participation policy and (b) high levels of allied programme integration and industrial collaboration, and what design features of their policies appear to enable that coexistence?\nNegative or mixed comparative cases Which countries exhibit offset-related frictions that undermine partnership or alliance integration outcomes (e.g., deal failure, supplier withdrawal, interoperability delays, diplomatic disputes), and what policy design features appear implicated?",

If the questions remain this broad and value-laden, the review risks pulling in a wide range of material that is hard to compare, while still missing key studies simply because they use different language (for example, “industrial cooperation”, “industrial participation”, “industrial and regional benefits”, “workshare”, or “local content” rather than “offsets”).\nA second issue is that several questions imply cause-and-effect—offsets “support” or “hinder” partnerships—without clearly defining what counts as support or hindrance. In practice, much of the available evidence is descriptive, legal, or case-based and may only show associations or reported frictions, not clear causal impacts. Without more specific outcomes, it becomes difficult to draw defensible conclusions beyond general statements. “Strong partnership” could mean many things: smooth access to technology, programme participation, shared sustainment arrangements, stable export relationships, or political trust. Likewise, “alliance integration” could refer to operational interoperability, standardisation, procurement integration, or wider political alignment. These are not interchangeable. A rapid evidence synthesis will be stronger if it focuses on observable indicators (for example: co-development/co-production arrangements, supply-chain integration, shared maintenance and sustainment, adoption of common standards, documented procurement delays or supplier withdrawals, export-control deadlocks, or corruption investigations linked to offset activity).\nThe comparative “case” questions are the most promising, but they also need clearer criteria. Asking whether there are countries that combine offsets with strong strategic collaboration is a good way to ground the review in real-world experience. However, unless “strong industrial collaboration” is defined, the output can easily become a loose list of countries rather than an evidence-backed comparison. Collaboration can range from minor subcontracting through to licensed production, joint ventures, co-development, and shared sustainment—each with very different implications for sovereignty, security of supply, and interoperability. Similarly, “retaining an offset policy” could mean a formal mandatory regime, a voluntary industrial participation approach, or simply negotiated workshare expectations. Being explicit about what types of offset policy and what depth of collaboration you are looking for will make the case mapping more credible and repeatable.\nTo strengthen the review, the questions should be reframed slightly so they are easier to “find” in the literature and easier to answer with available evidence. A practical way to do this is to shift the emphasis from broad claims (“offsets support NATO alignment”) to mechanisms and conditions (“under what conditions and through what mechanisms do industrial participation requirements help or hinder alliance-relevant outcomes?”). That retains your policy intent but gives the review a clearer structure: what is the mechanism (technology transfer, local production, supply-chain diversification, governance design), what is the context (mandatory vs voluntary, direct vs indirect offsets, export-control environment, multinational programme setting), and what is the outcome (interoperability, timeliness, trust, cost, or corruption risk). This also makes it easier to handle contested evidence: where studies disagree, you can explain how different contexts or policy designs may account for different outcomes rather than forcing a single verdict.\nFinally, there is a retrieval and bias risk that is worth flagging upfront in your report. If the search strategy requires papers to mention “alliance” or “partnership” alongside “offsets,” it will miss a lot of relevant material, because many offset studies talk about industrial policy, technology transfer, and governance without using alliance language. Conversely, alliance interoperability literatures often discuss procurement and industrial cooperation without using the term “offset”. The recommendation is to use a two-stage approach: first retrieve the broader offset/industrial participation evidence and the industrial cooperation evidence separately (including synonyms), then screen and tag it against your NATO-first operational concept. This is more realistic for a rapid synthesis and reduces the chance that “no results” is mistaken for “no evidence”.\nOverall, the recommended refinements are modest but important: define key terms in plain operational language; specify a short set of measurable outcomes; treat “support” and “hindrance” as mechanisms and conditions rather than assumed effects; and use a case selection rubric so the positive and negative examples are comparable. These changes will make the evidence synthesis easier to execute, more transparent to readers, and more useful for decisions about whether (and how) an offset policy could be compatible with a NATO-first defence posture.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Defence offsets – compensation agreements linked to arms procurement – have become a standard feature of international defence trade. In a typical offset arrangement, the buyer government requires the foreign supplier to direct a portion of the contract value back into the buyer’s economy, through investments, technology transfers, or purchases (TransparencyInternational2010Offsets?). Such practices are widespread have been known to exceed 100% of the main contract’s value (Markowski and Hall 2014). Proponents tout offsets as “win–win” deals that foster industrial development and technology gains for buyers while helping sellers secure contracts. Critics counter that the reality seldom matches the rhetoric, citing inefficiencies, inflated costs, and corruption risks (TransparencyInternational2010Offsets?). This realist literature review examines the impact of defence offsets by synthesizing evidence from diverse case studies through the lens of context–mechanism–outcome (CMO) configurations. We explore contexts (geographic, economic, political) in which offsets are implemented, analyse the mechanisms they trigger (technology transfer, local industry development, etc.), and assess the outcomes – intended and unintended – that result. Illustrative examples are drawn from Southeast Asia (e.g. Malaysia and Indonesia), Europe (including Switzerland and Visegrád Group countries), and beyond. Critical perspectives on corruption, policy design (such as offset multipliers), and absorptive capacity are integrated. The goal is to identify patterns of what works (or fails), for whom, and under what circumstances, thereby providing a nuanced understanding of defence offsets’ role in defence-industrial development.",

    "section": "4.1 Southeast Asia: Malaysia’s and Indonesia’s Offset Journeys",
    "text": "4.1 Southeast Asia: Malaysia’s and Indonesia’s Offset Journeys\nMalaysia – High Hopes and Mixed Outcomes: Malaysia embraced defence offsets in the 1990s as a key instrument for defence-industrialisation. Big-ticket arms purchases – from British, Russian, American, French, and other suppliers – were all tied to offset requirements aimed at technology transfer and local industry involvement. Notably, even before a formal policy existed, Malaysia pursued ad hoc offsets on major deals, seeking a “third-way” to industrial development beyond classic import-substitution or export-promotion. The context was an emerging economy with aspirations (articulated in Vision 2020) to leap into high-tech sectors like aerospace. Offsets were implicitly seen as a catalyst for this technological transformation (Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets?).\nMechanisms in Malaysia’s case centred on direct offsets: foreign vendors were obligated to invest in Malaysian defence-related projects or partner with local firms. Because no unified policy existed until 2005, implementation was uneven – the nature and quality of offset projects depended largely on the “skills and experience of individual project teams” and the negotiating clout of the government at the time. In 1999 the Finance Ministry issued guidelines (e.g. defining thresholds and priority areas) to formalize the process, and by 2005 an official offset policy came into force. The mechanisms deployed included local license production/assembly of aircraft parts, maintenance and overhaul facilities, training programs, and some technology collaborations in aerospace and electronics. An illustrative outcome was the growth of Malaysia’s aerospace composites sector: offset arrangements led to local companies gaining specialized skills in composite manufacturing and integration, plugging into global supply chains for major aviation programs. This is cited as a success – offsets facilitated specialization, competitiveness and high value-added operations in Malaysia’s aerospace industry, with local firms becoming suppliers and partners at the global level (Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets?).\nHowever, the outcomes overall were mixed and leaning toward disappointment. After nearly two decades of offset experience, Malaysia had not achieved its overarching goal of defence-industrial self-reliance; the country still lacked the ability to design and produce complex weaponry independently. A detailed assessment by Balakrishnan and Matthews (Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets?) finds that while offsets “exerted a positive impact on the local industrial landscape”, the progress was modest and fragmented. By the mid-2000s, about 60% of Malaysia’s offset projects had been directed towards training and through-life support (maintenance, spare parts) rather than actual R&D or high-end manufacturing. This focus yielded some skilled personnel but negligible local R&D capacity and very limited job creation – “woeful” in the authors’ words. There was impressive industrial diversification, yet much of it was in commercial (civil sector) activities spun off from defence deals. In other words, offsets sometimes helped Malaysian firms pivot to profitable civilian markets (a serendipitous benefit), but did not strongly anchor a self-sustaining defence production base. On balance, Malaysia’s offset experience is judged “disappointing, with the costs seemingly outweighing the benefits”. The disappointing progress – decades of offsets and still a “distant goal” of self-reliance – prompted Malaysia to tighten its policy framework in 2005 and beyond. It was hoped that clearer guidelines, higher local content targets, and better project selection could improve outcomes. It may be too early to fully judge the post-2005 era, but the lesson from the 1990s–2000s was clear: without a coherent strategy and strong absorptive capacity, offsets did not automatically translate into the advanced defence-industrial capabilities Malaysia sought.\nIndonesia – Offsets for Strategic Autonomy: Indonesia provides a more recent example of an emerging economy attempting to leverage offsets for strategic and economic ends. With a large population and modest industrial base, Indonesia long imported major weapon systems. A turning point came with a 2012 defence industry law that encapsulated a political resolve to never again be crippled by foreign embargoes (Indonesia had experienced U.S. arms embargoes in the past). The law mandated that if foreign procurement is inevitable, it must include countertrade, local content, and offsets to the fullest extent. This led to the implementation of a comprehensive offset policy from 2014, under Government Regulation No. 76/2014, later refined by a 2015 Ministerial Regulation (Maharani and Matthews 2022). Indonesia’s offset mechanism is notably stringent and prescriptive: no minimum contract threshold (even relatively small deals require offsets), 35% minimum offset/local content on any defence contract value (combined with countertrade, total local contribution must reach at least 85%) with a planned 10% increase every five years. The policy also introduced multipliers (1x to 3x), with the highest multipliers given to activities linked to seven strategic technology areas (jet fighters, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets, radars, propellants) that Indonesia prioritizes for indigenous development. Additionally, penalties of up to 5% of contract value can be imposed for non-fulfilment, signalling serious intent (Maharani and Matthews 2022).\nThe initial rollout of this aggressive policy was challenging. Foreign suppliers were confused and reluctant in the face of Indonesia’s new rules, which initially lacked clarity in terms of contractual requirements, monitoring, and penalties. Negotiations stalled on several programs when vendors hesitated to commit to Indonesia’s demands (Maharani and Matthews 2022). It wasn’t until 2015 – after the creation of an ad-hoc Offset Team to issue detailed guidelines – that implementation gained momentum. From 2015 to 2019, Indonesia saw a surge of offset activity: 31 offset programs were initiated in this period. Two smaller projects were completed (military bridges and trainer aircraft), 25 projects were in execution (including a degaussing system and a Sukhoi fighter simulator), and others were in negotiation. A landmark case was the 2018 contract for 11 Russian Su-35 fighters (~US$1.1 billion): Indonesia structured it such that about 50% of the payment value was in commodities (countertrade, e.g. palm oil) and 35.3% of the contract value entailed offsets. In effect, Indonesia leveraged its natural resources as partial payment while insisting on technology and local involvement as well – a creative approach to meet financial and industrial goals simultaneously (Maharani and Matthews 2022).\nThe outcomes in Indonesia are still unfolding, but early indications show some tangible benefits. By 2019, the offset projects had generated an estimated US$3.1 billion in investments, equivalent to 75% of the combined value of the procurement programs launched in that period (Maharani and Matthews 2022). This suggests that Indonesia was largely successful in enforcing its offset percentage targets. More importantly, qualitative outcomes at state-owned defence firms hint at progress in capability. For instance, PT Pindad (Indonesia’s primary land systems company) went through phased capacity-building via offsets: in the first stage of partnerships, it received training, technical assistance, and basic assembly know-how (but produced no exports or R&D). In a second stage, Pindad improved skills (training, assembly) and know-how (including work discipline and language skills for international collaboration). By a later stage, Pindad was engaging in manufacturing and integrating more complex subsystems (electronics and weapon integration) and even achieving small-scale supply chain creation and low-value exports. Although advanced R&D was still absent, this progression illustrates how sustained offsets can incrementally move a local industry up the value chain (Maharani and Matthews 2022).\nIndonesia’s case underscores the importance of political context and institutional follow-through. The driving motivation was clearly strategic autonomy – offsets are seen as a tool to ensure that Indonesia can maintain and operate its arsenal without overreliance on foreign suppliers or vulnerability to sanctions (Maharani and Matthews 2022). The government demonstrated commitment by creating new bureaucratic mechanisms (the Offset Team, detailed regulations) and pushing both foreign suppliers and domestic stakeholders to comply. By 2017, suppliers had come to a “grudging acceptance” that robust offsets were a permanent feature of Indonesia’s defence market. This acceptance was aided by the government’s willingness to negotiate and adjust – e.g., clarifying rules and perhaps showing flexibility in how offset credit could be earned. Indonesia also cleverly tied offsets to broader economic policy, using countertrade (commodity exports) to offset costs and ensure deals were palatable to both sides.\nComparative insights (Malaysia & Indonesia): Both Malaysia and Indonesia illustrate the use of offsets in Southeast Asia to build defence-industrial capacity and broader economic benefits. Malaysia’s earlier, laissez-faire approach (with weak coordination and late policy formalization) resulted in more piecemeal outcomes, while Indonesia’s highly centralized and mandatory approach kick-started many projects in a short time. Yet, they also share challenges common to emerging economies: the absorptive capacity constraint – e.g., Malaysia struggled to move beyond licensed assembly to true innovation (limited R&D absorption), and Indonesia still relies on foreign technology leadership in its offset projects. Both countries highlight that offsets are no panacea; they require strong policy guidance and realistic expectations. They also show some positive unintended outcomes: Malaysia channelled some defence offsets into successful civilian sectors (aerospace parts), and Indonesia leveraged offsets for diplomatic and economic ends (barter trade and defence ties with Russia and others). Notably, neither case has been tarnished by major corruption scandals in offsets (at least publicly), perhaps due to the relatively controlled nature of these programs by the state – though Malaysia’s offsets did suffer from opacity and lack of oversight in earlier years. Moving forward, these cases will be watched to see if initial gains (skills, partial local production) can evolve into sustained independent capabilities – or if they plateau once offset obligations are met.",

    "section": "4.2 Central and Eastern Europe: Visegrád Group Experiences",
    "text": "4.2 Central and Eastern Europe: Visegrád Group Experiences\nThe Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries provide a contrasting regional context: transitioning economies and new NATO members in the early 2000s, eager both to modernize militaries and to boost their economies after the Soviet era. Offsets were seen as a tool for economic revival at a time when foreign investment, job creation, and technology inflows were urgently needed (Lazar 2019). The Visegrád Group – Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia – each pursued offsets in their defence procurement, with varying degrees of success.\nPoland – Offsets to Underwrite Modernization: Poland, the largest Visegrád country, made one of the region’s most ambitious offset deals when it decided to purchase 48 F-16 fighter jets from the United States in 2003. In that high-profile competition, the U.S. F-16 faced off against offers from European suppliers (such as the Dassault Mirage 2000 and Saab Gripen). Poland’s government evaluated bids not only on technical and cost merits but heavily on offset packages. In fact, the proposed offsets sometimes carried equal or greater weight than price in these decisions. Lockheed Martin clinched the deal in no small part due to an unprecedented offset offer valued at over $9 billion – far exceeding the ~$3.5 billion cost of the jets themselves (Dehoff2014Offsets?). This package comprised offset projects: 55 in the defence sector (e.g. co-production of aircraft components, local servicing facilities, cooperation with Polish defence firms) and 49 in the broader Polish economy (Dehoff2014Offsets?). The projects spanned aerospace, electronics, automotive, and even commercial ventures, aiming to inject technology and capital across Poland’s industrial landscape. Contemporary reports cited Lockheed’s massive offset commitment as “a major reason” Poland chose the F-16 over competing aircraft. In essence, Poland leveraged its purchase to also buy a stimulus for its economy.\nThe outcome of Poland’s F-16 offset program was closely watched. In quantitative terms, the Ministry of Economy in later years reported high fulfilment rates by Lockheed and its partners – by one account, over 90% of the promised offset value was realized within a decade, creating thousands of jobs (at least temporarily) and boosting exports in some sectors. Qualitatively, some Polish companies gained new capabilities: for example, WSK Rzeszów (a Polish aerospace firm) received work share in engine production, and the Polish defence electronics industry benefited from joint projects. However, independent evaluations noted that not all offsets created lasting value. A portion of the “offset” consisted of one-off business contracts or simple purchases from Polish suppliers, which, while meeting the letter of obligations, did not always lead to sustained industrial growth. There were also delays and difficulties in implementing some high-technology projects. Overall, Poland’s strategy did achieve a short-term infusion of investment and know-how – it “provided the highest possible economic impact” as intended – but it is debatable how much of that translated into long-term competitiveness. Still, Poland stands out as a case where offsets were actively managed as a national program to advance both defence and civil industry goals, and where the government was willing to enforce penalties on underperforming offset projects (Poland had passed an “offset law” with penalty clauses (AviationWeek2003PolandOffset?)). This assertiveness might explain the relatively high completion rate of offset commitments there.\nCzech Republic and Hungary – Gripen Deals and Controversy: The Czech Republic and Hungary, both NATO entrants in 1999, each needed to replace outdated Soviet-era fighter jets. In the early 2000s, they independently came to the decision to acquire the Swedish/British JAS-39 Gripen. Both governments entered lease-to-buy arrangements for 14 Gripen fighters each (Czech deal ~$750 million for a 10-year lease; Hungary ~$900 million) [CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021]. Offsets were integral to these deals: Saab and its partner BAE Systems offered sizable offset packages to sweeten the agreement. Publicly, these were framed as opportunities to invigorate local industries – much like in Poland, promises were made of investments, joint ventures, and manufacturing work in the Czech and Hungarian economies.\nHowever, the mechanism behind the scenes appears to have also included illicit payments. Subsequent investigations and media exposés (led by Swedish and UK outlets) uncovered a network of middlemen and alleged bribes used to secure the Gripen selection. An Austrian businessman working as BAE’s agent in Central Europe, Count Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly, was identified as a key figure who funnelled commissions to decision-makers (CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021?). Documents later suggested that as much as SEK 735 million (≈ €80 million) was earmarked for paying off about 20 Czech politicians and officials, and another SEK 126 million for five Hungarian contacts. These alleged bribes correspond to the period when both countries were evaluating bids – notably, American competitors (Lockheed Martin and Boeing offering the F-16 and F-18) withdrew from the Czech tender, citing that the conditions were rigged in favour of the Gripen and that it was “impossible for them to compete” in such circumstances (CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021?). This implies that beyond the above-board offsets, under-the-table incentives tilted the playing field.\nThe outcomes of the Czech and Hungarian Gripen offsets are therefore intertwined with corruption outcomes. On one hand, the two countries did receive the Gripen fighters which have been operational for their air forces (and both later extended their lease or purchase agreements, indicating satisfaction with the platform). On the economic side, some legitimate offset projects did take place. For example, in the Czech Republic, Saab/BAE fulfilled offset obligations by investing in Czech aerospace and automotive firms and by facilitating exports of Czech products. Reports claim the Czech offset program (valued at 130% of the Gripen contract) was completed successfully in terms of numbers, contributing to areas like aircraft maintenance capabilities and new factories for aviation components. Hungary similarly saw investments and partnerships (with an even larger offset requirement, purportedly 110% of contract). Yet, these outcomes are clouded by the sense that they could have been larger or more effective were it not for governance issues. An analysis by Zsolt Lazar (2019) finds that the Gripen offset programs fell short of delivering the transformative impact hoped for. One reason was that both countries, especially Hungary, failed to maximize the benefits – possibly due to weaker institutional capacity to absorb and direct the offsets (a smaller industrial base than Poland, for instance) and possibly because corruption diverted focus from genuine industrial objectives. In Hungary’s case, there was little transparency on offset results; even a parliamentary inquiry in 2007 kept its findings classified and noted that key procurement documents had “disappeared,” hampering oversight (CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021?). This suggests that not only was corruption a risk, it may have materially impaired the implementation and monitoring of the offset projects. In short, while some factories were built and some jobs created under the Gripen offsets, neither Czechia nor Hungary experienced a defence-industrial renaissance; the deals ultimately served to equip the air force with modern fighters (the primary goal) but the broader economic spin-offs were modest once the initial flurry of offset activities subsided.\nSlovakia and others: Slovakia, the fourth Visegrád member, also engaged in offsets for some defence procurements (e.g. radar systems, armoured vehicles), but on a smaller scale as its acquisitions were more limited. More recently, as Slovakia opted in 2018 to buy U.S. F-16s, it negotiated industrial cooperation agreements rather than formal offsets, partly reflecting NATO standardization and lessons learned from neighbours. Other CEE countries outside Visegrád, like Romania and Bulgaria, likewise pursued offsets in aircraft or naval purchases in the 2000s, often facing similar hurdles of limited absorptive capacity and occasionally controversy. Romania’s attempt to demand offsets for multi-role fighters was complicated by financial constraints and ultimately it bought second-hand F-16s with minimal offsets. Overall, the CEE experience shows how pivotal context is: these mid-sized economies saw offsets as a remedy for post-communist economic woes, but the success correlated with how robust and transparent their governance was. Poland, with stronger institutions and a larger industrial base, arguably extracted more value (in scale if not in efficiency) from offsets. Smaller states or those with governance deficits realized fewer lasting benefits – and, in the worst cases, offsets became entangled with patronage networks and corruption, as the Gripen case exemplifies.",

    "section": "4.3 Western Europe and Advanced Economies: Offsets under Scrutiny",
    "text": "4.3 Western Europe and Advanced Economies: Offsets under Scrutiny\nIn Western Europe and other advanced economies, defence offsets have been practiced under a different context – one of generally mature industries and, more recently, regulatory pushback. Two focal points here are Switzerland, a neutral advanced economy that relies on foreign arms but wants to sustain a high-tech industry, and the European Union’s efforts to curb offsets among its member states.\nSwitzerland – Maintaining Domestic Industry: Switzerland has a long-standing offset policy aimed at ensuring that when it buys major defence equipment from abroad, its own industry benefits in return. The context is a country with a capable but niche defence–industrial sector (e.g. precision manufacturing, optics, aerospace components) that cannot survive on domestic military orders alone. Thus, the government views offsets as a tool to keep Swiss defence firms engaged and technologically advanced, and to “reduce…dependency on foreign countries” while strengthening national supply security (SwissFedCouncil2021OffsetPolicy?). Traditionally, Switzerland required offset equal to 100% of the contract value for large purchases (BIS2003SixthOffsetReport?) – effectively a one-to-one reinvestment. These offsets could be direct (related to the defence item) or indirect (unrelated sectors), and Swiss firms across various domains (from metallurgy to electronics to services) have received business as a result (Janes2021?). For example, when Switzerland procured F/A-18 Hornet fighters in the 1990s, offset deals included Swiss companies manufacturing parts of the aircraft and foreign contractors funding R&D at Swiss tech institutes. Similarly, recent programs (like the purchase of new air defence systems or consideration of new fighter jets) come with mandated offsets that foreign bidders must incorporate.\nThe mechanisms Switzerland employs have evolved. As of July 2021, Switzerland “tweaked” its offset policy with some nuanced changes. It introduced a threshold: only contracts above CHF 20 million incur offset obligations, so smaller deals won’t trigger the administrative burden of offsets. It also granted Armasuisse (the defence procurement agency) more flexibility to award multipliers up to 3× for high-value activities (Janes2021?). This means if a foreign supplier engages in a project deemed exceptionally beneficial (say, transferring cutting-edge aerospace manufacturing to a Swiss plant), each franc invested might count triple towards their offset requirement – a clear incentive to propose top-tier technology collaborations. The updated policy clarifies eligible offset activities: co-production, licensed production, subcontracting to Swiss companies, technology and expertise transfer, project financing in Switzerland, and even marketing support for Swiss products are all creditable. Interestingly, the policy delineates a wide array of sectors, well beyond traditional defence manufacturing – including chemicals, electronics, vehicles, telecommunications, IT services, R&D, etc. This breadth shows Switzerland’s interest in maximizing offsets for general industrial and technological benefit, not just narrow defence needs.\nThe outcomes for Switzerland have generally been positive in the sense that offsets are credited with helping sustain high-skilled jobs and companies. Swiss industry associations often lobby for strong offsets to ensure they get a share of big contracts. For example, with the planned procurement of the F-35A Lightning II jets (a deal decided in 2021), Switzerland has stipulated a 60% offset (lower than 100% historically, possibly due to the EU pressure and the unique nature of the F-35 global supply chain). Even so, this means over CHF 4 billion of work should flow to Swiss firms, in areas like airframe components, engine parts, and software development, according to public statements. While some economists argue these requirements could increase the purchase price, Swiss policymakers contend that without offsets, domestic defence suppliers would atrophy and the country would lose sovereign capability in key technologies. No major corruption issues have surfaced in Swiss offset practices – likely owing to Switzerland’s strong governance and the transparent, codified process managed by Armasuisse. One could critique the efficiency (would free-market competition allocate resources better than offset mandates?), but politically, offsets enjoy support as they justify to the public the large expenditures on foreign weapons by ensuring local economic return. In sum, Switzerland demonstrates an advanced economy using offsets more as an industrial policy tool (to keep its tech sector vibrant) than as a developmental crutch. The context of a small, highly-skilled economy shapes this usage: Switzerland doesn’t seek to build an entire indigenous defence industry from scratch (it will always buy fighter jets abroad), but through offsets it leverages foreign deals to invest in its comparative advantages (precision engineering, etc.).\nEuropean Union – Phasing Out Offsets?: Within the EU, defence offsets have long been seen by the European Commission as distortions of the single market. Defence trade in the EU historically fell under national security exemptions, allowing member states to impose offsets and favour local suppliers. However, in 2009 the EU adopted the Defence Procurement Directive (2009/81/EC), aiming to introduce more competition and transparency in defence contracts across Europe. The Commission explicitly sought to reduce the use of Article 346 (the treaty clause allowing national security exemptions) that members used to justify offsets. The Directive and subsequent Commission guidance essentially declared that offsets are protectionist and violate EU principles of non-discrimination . Unless an offset can be strictly justified as necessary for essential security interests (and directly related to the item procured), it should not be used. Indirect offsets, by definition unrelated to the purchased system, were deemed incompatible with EU law and “in any case prohibited.”. The Commission urged member states to instead use the new legal framework (e.g. allow some localization via subcontracting within competitive bidding, without explicit offset clauses). By making the rules of the game clearer, the Commission hoped to narrow the national security exemption and push states away from automatic offsets (Weiss and Blauberger 2015).\nThe impact of this EU policy shift was significant. Over the 2010s, most EU countries revised or scrapped their formal offset policies. By 2013, after transposition of the directive, the European defence market saw a decline in offset arrangements – particularly indirect offsets essentially disappeared in EU deals, and direct offsets became rarer or smaller in scope. Matthews and Anicetti (2020) note that this “gradual demise of offset” in Europe aligns with a global trend among advanced countries moving away from offsets. Countries like the UK had already reduced offsets (the UK shifted to more flexible “industrial participation” approaches), and smaller EU members complied to avoid infringement procedures. The Commission did follow up: in 2016 it warned several states to halt offset practices or face legal action. Greece learned this the hard way in a case where the European Court of Justice struck down its attempt to require local production of submarine components as unjustified. Thus, within the EU, formal offset as a policy became largely delegitimized.\nHowever, there are nuances. The EU did allow certain exclusions – joint development programs (like the Eurofighter) and government-to-government sales can be exempt from the directive. Many countries have since framed industrial benefits not as “offset obligations” but as part of the package in G2G deals (which the directive doesn’t fully govern). For example, when Finland bought F-35s (a non-EU product via a U.S. FMS deal), it still arranged industrial participation for Finnish firms, describing it in terms of security of supply rather than offsets per se. Similarly, current large projects under EU auspices emphasize cooperative development instead of classical offsets. The net effect is that in Western Europe, the culture around offsets changed – from being a routine sweetener to something done more subtly or justified in different terms. Advanced European defence suppliers (like France, Germany, Sweden) were somewhat supportive of reducing offsets, since they often had been on the hook to provide them; eliminating offsets could lower their costs and avoid “inefficient resource allocation and anti-competitive market behaviours” that offsets entailed. Indeed, as Matthews and Anicetti (2020) put it, Europeans had for decades articulated offsets with “win-win” narratives that seldom matched reality, as many offset programs “failed to generate enduring high value investment and skilled employment” while often adding cost premiums to deals. By 2020, offset was increasingly seen as a phenomenon “for developing countries”, not something advanced integrated markets should do.\nThat said, strategic and political realities sometimes reassert themselves. The Commission’s vision of a pure open market met pushback from some member states concerned about their defence industries. Countries like Poland and offset-dependent economies in CEE were wary of losing out on local benefits. France and others insist on European preference in subtle ways. Moreover, after 2022 (with massive rearmament programs in Europe), even the Commission has softened stance on using defence procurement as a tool to bolster the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). One could argue this is a return of “offset-like” thinking, but within Europe rather than nationally – encouraging contracts to stay in Europe (which in effect is like an intra-EU offset approach). Nonetheless, formally, the EU made offsets a dirty word and forced a realignment: countries like Italy, the Netherlands, Norway (the latter two are European but non-EU NATO members who followed similar logic) dropped their old offset mandates.\nIn summary, advanced economies have trended toward minimizing traditional offsets, driven by both recognition of their flaws and by multilateral rules. Offsets in these contexts have shifted toward “best value” procurement models that still allow industrial benefits but under stricter rules. The contrast with emerging economies is stark: while Indonesia mandates 35% local content, a country like Australia outright abolished offsets in the 1990s as a policy decision, judging them counterproductive. The United States, as a seller, has never officially recognized offsets domestically (the U.S. does not demand offsets for its own imports and calls its domestic preferences “Buy American” rather than offsets). However, U.S. companies do engage in offsets abroad and the U.S. government monitors it. A 2017 U.S. report showed declining offset obligations for American exporters, indicating perhaps that even buyers were asking for less, or at least that deals were structured differently. Taken together, one can say context is key: in advanced economies with strong domestic industries, offsets are viewed as distortions to phase out, whereas in less developed economies, offsets remain an alluring policy to obtain foreign investment and tech.",

    "text": "We will use a blended method designed for complex policy questions where outcomes depend heavily on context. First, we will run a realist evidence synthesis to explain how and why offset and industrial participation policies interact with alliance priorities such as interoperability, readiness and security of supply. Realist synthesis is appropriate here because “offsets” are not a single, standard intervention: they cover a range of tools (for example workshare, technology transfer, co-production, multipliers, and governance requirements) that operate differently in different procurement systems and security environments. Rather than asking whether offsets are “good” or “bad” in general, the realist component will identify the main causal pathways that the literature describes and test them against the evidence, focusing on what tends to work, for whom, and under what conditions.\nThe realist synthesis will be structured using a simple “context–mechanism–outcome” logic. We will extract from each source: (i) the context (such as whether offsets are mandatory or voluntary; direct or indirect; the sensitivity of the technology; export control constraints; the maturity of the domestic industrial base; and whether procurement is part of a multinational programme), (ii) the mechanism (the process through which the policy is expected to produce effects, such as creating incentives for supply-chain integration, building local sustainment capacity, or, conversely, increasing opacity and broker involvement), and (iii) the outcomes (observable effects relevant to a NATO-aligned posture, such as standardisation and interoperability, delivery speed and readiness, resilience and security of supply, or partnership frictions such as delays, supplier withdrawal, or political controversy). This approach allows us to distinguish what the evidence shows, what it claims, and where findings are contested or depend on specific conditions.\nIn parallel, we will conduct a structured comparative case mapping exercise to answer the “which countries” questions. This second component is necessary because the evidence base on offsets is spread across academic studies, official policy documents, audits, legal commentary, and case reporting, and countries often use different labels for similar practices (industrial participation, industrial cooperation, IRB/ITB, localisation). Case mapping will not produce a league table. Instead, it will use a consistent rubric to compare a short list of relevant countries and programmes on a small set of dimensions: the design of the offset/industrial participation policy; the depth of industrial collaboration achieved (from subcontracting through to licensed production, co-production, co-development and shared sustainment); markers of alliance and programme integration (for example standardisation, shared sustainment arrangements, and participation in multinational programmes); and documented risks or frictions (such as corruption vulnerabilities, export-control deadlock, cost/schedule impacts, or partnership disputes). Each case will be assigned an evidence confidence judgement based on the quality and transparency of the underlying sources.\nThe literature search will be designed to avoid missing relevant evidence because of inconsistent terminology. We will use a two-lane search strategy. One lane will focus on offsets and industrial participation directly (including their common synonyms), and the other will focus on alliance-relevant industrial cooperation and interoperability outcomes, where the term “offset” may not appear. We will search academic databases and targeted repositories, but will also systematically include high-value grey literature (government policy and guidance, audit reports, NATO/EU/EDA material, and reputable governance and anti-corruption analysis), because many of the most informative “hinderance” and risk cases are documented outside journals. Screening decisions will be based on pre-specified inclusion criteria (defence procurement relevance, time period, and presence of identifiable mechanisms and outcomes), not simply on whether “alliance” language appears in the abstract.\nFinally, synthesis will be reported in two linked outputs. The realist synthesis will provide a set of evidence-backed statements about mechanisms and conditions—what types of offset design appear compatible with NATO-aligned outcomes, what designs are associated with recurring risks, and which mitigation measures are credible. The comparative case mapping will provide a transparent set of positive, negative, and mixed cases with short explanatory notes that connect each case back to the realist mechanisms. Taken together, this approach produces policy-useful conclusions while staying honest about what the evidence can and cannot prove: it supports reasoned judgements about design choices and trade-offs, rather than overstating causal certainty or implying that cross-country experiences are directly comparable in all respects.\n\n\nWe used a targeted, two-lane search strategy designed to reflect how this topic is discussed in practice. Defence offsets are often written about as “industrial participation”, “industrial cooperation”, “industrial and regional benefits” (IRB/ITB), “workshare”, “local content”, or “localisation”, while alliance outcomes are more commonly described in terms of “interoperability”, “standardisation”, “security of supply”, “readiness”, “sustainment”, and “supply-chain resilience”. To avoid missing relevant evidence because of inconsistent terminology, we searched in parallel for (i) the offsets/industrial participation literature and (ii) the alliance-relevant defence-industrial cooperation and interoperability literature, then screened and coded results against the review questions.\nThe first lane focused on offsets and industrial participation directly. Searches combined defence procurement terms (defence/defense, defence procurement, military procurement) with offset/IP synonyms (defence/defense offsets, industrial participation, industrial cooperation, industrial compensation, IRB/ITB, workshare, local content, localisation). From this broad set, we ran focused searches that added one additional concept at a time rather than requiring multiple concepts simultaneously. These focused variants targeted (a) durable industrial collaboration mechanisms (co-development, co-production, licensed production, technology transfer, joint ventures, shared sustainment/MRO and supply-chain integration), (b) risks and governance issues (corruption and transparency risks, intermediaries/brokers, export-control friction including ITAR, compliance, delays and cost impacts, market distortion and programme fragmentation), and (c) comparative or case-based evidence (case study, country, comparative, typology, policy regime). This staged approach was used because requiring many concepts to appear together in titles and abstracts can produce false “no evidence” signals even when relevant work exists.\nThe second lane focused on alliance-relevant outcomes and defence-industrial cooperation, recognising that many sources discuss interoperability and industrial integration without using the term “offset”. These searches combined defence-industrial cooperation terms (defence industrial cooperation/collaboration, defence industry, industrial cooperation) with alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability, standardisation, security of supply, readiness, sustainment/MRO, and supply chains). We then used follow-on searches to connect this literature back to offset-related mechanisms by adding terms such as workshare, local content, technology transfer, co-production, licensed production, and industrial participation. NATO-specific keywords (NATO, alliance, Euro-Atlantic, coalition, multinational programme) were used selectively as a secondary narrowing step rather than as a primary filter, because many relevant studies treat alliance integration implicitly through standards, shared sustainment arrangements, or procurement coordination rather than naming NATO directly.\nWe conducted searches in Scopus and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed and academic-adjacent evidence, and we also searched NATO-related sources (including NATO websites and library-style repositories) using shorter keyword bundles that reflect the limited Boolean functionality of many institutional search tools. In addition, we systematically searched grey literature because many of the most informative sources on risks, failures, and governance—particularly corruption vulnerabilities, audit findings, programme delays, and export-control constraints—are documented outside academic journals. Grey literature searching used targeted repository and “site:” searches across national governments and procurement agencies, audit and parliamentary bodies, NATO and allied institutions, and reputable policy and governance organisations. Across all channels we prioritised material published from 2000 onwards, while retaining older “anchor” sources where they were repeatedly cited or essential to understanding terminology and mechanisms.\nAll results were screened for relevance using operational criteria aligned to the review questions rather than relying on the presence of specific keywords. Sources were included if they addressed offsets/industrial participation or closely related industrial cooperation tools in defence procurement and contained identifiable mechanisms, contextual conditions, and alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability/standardisation, readiness, security of supply, sustainment integration) or documented partnership frictions (such as supplier withdrawal, deal failure, delays, disputes, corruption allegations, or export-control deadlocks). This approach ensures the evidence base is broad enough to capture real-world policy experience while still being structured around the mechanisms and outcomes needed to answer the five research questions.",

    "title": "Global Defence Offset Regimes (1990-Present)",
    "section": "2 Typology of Defence Offset Regimes",
    "text": "2 Typology of Defence Offset Regimes\nOffsets can be classified along several key dimensions. Below is a typology of defence offset regimes, highlighting how different countries or contracts may approach these arrangements:\n\n2.1 Mandatory vs. Voluntary Offsets\nMandatory offsets are those formally required by the purchasing government, often by law or policy, as a fixed condition (e.g. “at least 50% of the contract value must be offset”). In such cases, foreign suppliers must agree to specified offset obligations to secure the deal. For example, Poland’s offset law around 2003 required contractors to invest an amount equal to 100% of the fighter jet contract’s value back into Poland’s economy [6]. Many countries - especially emerging arms importers - adopted mandatory offset policies in the 1990s and 2000s to maximize local benefits. However, analysts like Hall and Markowski argue that across-the-board mandatory offsets tend to cause trade distortions and inefficiencies, effectively a tax on the purchase [2]. Empirical studies find that such imposed offsets seldom deliver net economic gains and can raise procurement costs [2].\nBy contrast, voluntary offsets are negotiated case-by-case and not universally required - they arise from suppliers offering side-deals or governments striking bargains, but without a blanket mandate. If offsets are voluntarily agreed (for instance, as part of a competitive bid), they might avoid some welfare loss since they can be tailored to mutually beneficial projects [2]. Voluntary offsets are common in deals where the buyer has no formal offset law but expects some industrial cooperation; for example, the UK or Australia often pursue industrial participation informally in major purchases without an official percentage target. In practice, the line can blur: even with formal policies, many offsets are negotiated in detail, and major arms exporters will frequently volunteer attractive offset packages as a competitive “sweetener” to win contracts [brauer_arms_2004]. The 2003 Polish fighter competition illustrates this - Lockheed Martin clinched the deal by proposing an unprecedented \\$9+ billion offset package (far above the contract’s value) with dozens of projects, tipping the scales in its favor [4].\nOverall, the trend since 1990 has been toward mandated offsets in most large arms-importing countries, despite efficiency concerns [2]. Even so, some highly advanced buyers (e.g. Australia, discussed later) have moved away from strict mandates, preferring flexible or “best value” approaches to domestic industry involvement rather than rigid offset quotas.\n\n\n2.2 Direct vs. Indirect Offsets\nOffsets are also categorized as direct or indirect. Direct offsets refer to compensation activities that are directly related to the defence product being purchased ([4]]. These typically include things like co-production of the weapon system, licensed manufacturing of parts, maintenance and overhaul work, or technology transfer for the specific platform. For instance, if a country buys fighter jets, a direct offset could be the local assembly of some aircraft components or the joint production of missiles for those jets. India, for example, restricts offsets to defence-relevant activities only - meaning the foreign vendor must plow back investment or work into India’s defence, aerospace, or internal security sectors (such as sourcing sub-systems from Indian firms or partnering with local defence manufacturers) [7].\nIndirect offsets are benefits or projects unrelated to the purchased system, which can be either in the defence realm broadly or completely outside it[5]. These might include the foreign supplier investing in the buyer’s civil sectors, launching joint ventures in unrelated industries, or fulfilling certain general trade and investment obligations. For example, a Russian sale of Su-30 fighters to Malaysia was tied to an offset where Sukhoi helped Malaysia’s civilian space agency with technology transfer - a civilian project offsetting a military purchase [4]. Classic indirect offsets in past deals have ranged from building petrochemical plants, to purchasing commodities, to setting up vocational training centers in the buying country [5]. Indirect offsets can also be defence-indirect (e.g. investing in a different defence program or sector than the purchased item) or civilian. In Saudi Arabia’s 1985 Al-Yamamah arms deal, for instance, the UK supplier (BAE Systems) agreed to develop a local sugar refinery and a pharmaceutical plant as part of the offset, which had no direct link to the Tornado aircraft being sold [5].\nOver the years, indirect offsets have grown in scope, especially as countries use defence purchases to drive broader economic goals. In fact, as one survey notes, offsets evolved from straightforward military co-production in earlier decades to more creative arrangements: defence-to-civil offsets (military contracts fulfilled by investing in civil sectors), then even civil-to-civil offsets, and lately “civil-to-defense” deals (where, say, a commercial aircraft sale might require investment in the buyer’s defence industry)[2]. Many offset programs now allow a mix of direct and indirect credits, sometimes with multipliers to favor certain activities (for example, a country might give extra credit - say 2x value - for investments in high-priority sectors like cybersecurity or indigenous R&D)[4, 7]. The balance between direct and indirect offsets often reflects a country’s priorities: those focused on building a domestic defence base prefer direct offsets, whereas those emphasizing general economic development or political gains may welcome indirect projects in infrastructure, education, or other industries.\n\n\n2.3 Formal vs. Informal Regimes\nThis dimension distinguishes how institutionalized a country’s offset practices are. A formal offset regime means the government has explicit policies, legislation, or dedicated agencies to manage offsets. These regimes have published guidelines on offset requirements (minimum percentage, eligible activities, penalty for non-performance, etc.) and a bureaucracy to negotiate and enforce offset contracts. India is a good example: since 2005 it has a formal Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) with an “Offset Clause” (initially 30% of deals over ₹300 crore) and an “Defence Offset Management Wing” to oversee implementation[7]. The United Arab Emirates likewise established the UAE Offsets Group (now Tawazun Economic Council) back in 1992 specifically to handle and channel offset investments. Formal regimes often make offsets mandatory by rule (as discussed earlier) and integrate them into the defence procurement cycle.\nIn contrast, informal offset arrangements occur in countries without a codified offset policy but where offsets still play a role on a case-by-case basis. These tend to be states that are either major arms producers themselves or have strategic procurement relationships. For instance, the United Kingdom historically had no general offset law requiring all foreign purchases to include offsets - however, in practice the UK government often negotiated industrial participation or technology sharing when buying abroad (especially for high-value projects). A recent example is Britain’s purchase of P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft from the US: while not bound by an offset policy, the deal was accompanied by commitments from Boeing to invest in UK aerospace infrastructure, effectively an informal offset to secure domestic benefits. Similarly, Australia explicitly eschews “classic” offsets - a 2016 policy statement affirmed Australia “does not have a policy of offsets” - instead using an Australian Industry Capability (AIC) program to encourage local content through contract incentives rather than fixed quotas. These informal approaches try to avoid the cost inflation associated with mandated offsets, yet still achieve some local industry involvement.\nIn summary, formal regimes provide clear rules but can become bureaucratic, whereas informal approaches offer flexibility but rely on ad hoc bargaining power. Notably, since 2010 the European Union has pushed members toward more informal/limited use of offsets: EU Directive 2009/81 on defence procurement required states to remove mandatory offset requirements from their laws (offsets are largely seen as protectionist under EU single-market principles) [1]. EU countries can still seek domestic industry benefits, but now usually justify them case-by-case under national security exceptions (Article 346 TFEU) or via soft mechanisms like requiring a certain portion of subcontracts to involve local firms [1]. This represents a shift from formal offset regimes to more constrained or “hidden” offsets in Europe.\n\n\n2.4 Buyer-Driven vs. Supplier-Driven Offsets\nAnother way to categorize offsets is by who initiates or drives the offset agreement. In buyer-driven offsets, the purchasing country’s government is in the driver’s seat: it demands specific offset commitments as a condition of the tender or purchase. Most mandatory offset regimes are inherently buyer-driven - the state lays out offset requirements in the RFP (Request for Proposal) and each bidder must respond with an acceptable offset plan. For example, when South Korea held its F-X III fighter competition in 2013, it explicitly weighted the evaluation such that 17% of the score was based on the offset and tech-transfer proposals, slightly more than the weight given to price [4]. This shows the buyer using offsets as a scoring criterion and leverage to extract technology. Buyer-driven offsets typically align with the importer’s strategic goals, but if pushed too far (demanding extremely high offsets), they risk deterring bidders or inflating costs.\nIn supplier-driven offsets, the impetus comes from the selling side - the contractor or exporting country offers an offset package to make their bid more attractive, even if not strictly required. As global arms markets grew more competitive post-Cold War, Western defense firms began viewing creative offset offers as a “competitive weapon” rather than just a contractual burden [4]. In bids to Brazil, India, and others, vendors often voluntarily pledged local partnerships, production lines, or investments to outmaneuver rivals. The Poland F-16 deal mentioned earlier is a prime example: Lockheed Martin’s supplier-driven generosity (with 100+ projects across Polish industry) set a new benchmark, forcing competitors to try to match such offers [4]. Supplier-driven offsets can also occur outside formal competitions - for instance, a company might approach a country with a proposal to sell a platform along with setting up a local maintenance facility or funding a technology center, enticing the buyer to consider the deal. This approach often reflects the exporter’s strategic interest in establishing a long-term foothold in the country. As one McKinsey analysis noted, while some contractors long saw offsets as a necessary evil, many now recognize offset deals can cement lasting market access and relationships in foreign markets [4].\nIn practice, most offset deals involve elements of both: the buyer sets expectations, and suppliers tailor their offset bids to exceed those expectations or address the buyer’s unique interests. It’s a negotiated process. Nonetheless, understanding who has the upper hand matters. Wealthy Gulf states, for example, often dictate offset terms (buyer-driven) given the allure of their contracts, whereas smaller buyers might rely on what sellers are willing to bring to the table. Finally, the political context can influence this dynamic - if a sale is geopolitically important to the seller’s government, the seller may proactively offer generous offsets (supplier-driven) to secure influence or alliance favor (making this also a foreign policy tool).\n\n\n2.5 Industrial vs. Strategic Orientation\nCountries also differ in whether they view offsets primarily as an industrial-economic tool or as a strategic security tool (or both). An industrial-oriented offset regime is one where the offsets are designed to spur economic development, commercial partnerships, and technological know-how in the civilian economy or general industrial base. The aims here include job creation, export promotion, diversification away from raw resource dependence, and general capacity-building. Many oil-rich states pursued offsets with an industrialization motive: Saudi Arabia’s Economic Offset Program explicitly sought to use defence deals to kick-start high-tech and manufacturing sectors, create skilled employment for Saudis, and move toward a knowledge-based economy. Offsets in such regimes often go into dual-use or civilian projects (as seen with Saudi’s offsets generating businesses like polymer chemical plants and engineering services and are evaluated by their economic return more than military value). Malaysia and Indonesia likewise leveraged defence purchases to gain investments in areas like aerospace, shipbuilding, or even agriculture - using offsets as a form of industrial policy.\nIn contrast, a strategic-oriented offset regime focuses on offsets as a means to achieve military or geopolitical objectives: building a strategic defence industry for self-reliance, acquiring sensitive technologies that bolster autonomy, or strengthening alliances and influence. India’s offset policy is a clear example - its primary goal is to attain greater self-reliance in arms production and high-end defence R&D, reducing dependence on foreign suppliers. Thus India insists on direct defence offsets only, aiming for technology transfers and indigenous production that enhance its strategic capabilities. Similarly, countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, and Israel have historically seen offsets (or related co-production programs) as a way to localize defense production and develop strategically critical technologies (from fighter jets to missiles) that would allow them to deter adversaries or be less vulnerable to foreign embargoes. Offsets here blur with pure military collaborations; for instance, Turkey joined the U.S.-led F-35 Joint Strike Fighter development - an arrangement not termed an offset per se, but motivated by the same strategic offset logic of tech gain and industrial involvement.\n“Strategic” can also imply political leverage: some offset deals are driven by the buyer’s intent to use the arms contract to gain broader political support or tie the supplier into a long-term partnership. For example, offset joint ventures can create constituencies within the supplier country that have a stake in the relationship (as seen when Boeing’s offset ventures in Saudi Arabia led to deeper business ties and continued arms sales). In that sense, offsets can serve as a form of strategic diplomacy, aligning the supplier’s interests with the buyer’s stability and development. However, offsets used for strategic aims can come with risks: advanced technology transfers are often tightly controlled (the U.S., for instance, has sometimes refused or delayed certain offsets that would give away crown-jewel tech, leading to friction with buyers like South Korea [3], and offset projects in sensitive sectors can become entangled in security and intellectual property disputes [8].\nIn summary, industrial vs. strategic orientation highlights the predominant lens through which a country justifies its offset program. In practice most regimes combine both - seeking industrial development that underpins strategic autonomy. But the emphasis can shift. For instance, Brazil pursued offsets with a mix of both aims: its 2014 Gripen fighter deal included deep technology transfer (strategic gain for its air force) while also partnering with local aerospace industry (industrial growth). On the other hand, South Africa’s late-1990s offset-driven arms procurement was sold mainly on economic-industrial grounds (promised jobs and investment), with less strategic rationale given the post-apartheid security environment - an approach that later drew criticism when the economic benefits failed to materialize as hoped.\nHaving outlined the typological dimensions, we now turn to country-level case studies of major defence offset regimes since 1990. These illustrate how different nations have implemented offsets, their policy evolution, goals, mechanisms, outcomes, and challenges.",

    "text": "3 Country Case Studies of Offset Regimes\n\n3.1 India\nTimeline and Policy Evolution: India had experiences with de facto offsets (licensed production of foreign arms) since the 1960s, but only established a formal offset policy in 2005 as part of its Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)[59]. The 2005 policy mandated at least 30% offsets for any defence import contract above ₹300 crore (about \\$50-60 million)[35]. This was a response to India’s surging arms imports and desire to leverage that buying power for indigenous industry growth[60][61]. Over time, the policy was refined: offset “routes” were defined to include direct purchase of Indian defence goods, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indian defence firms or R&D, and later even technology transfers with multiplier credits[62]. Revisions in 2008-2011 expanded the scope slightly (allowing offsets in related areas like internal security, civil aerospace and training) but India has consistently restricted offsets to defence and aerospace sectors, i.e. only direct or defence-related indirect offsets are counted[26][62]. The DPP has been updated almost every 2-3 years, tweaking offset guidelines (e.g. introducing offset banking to allow credits from one contract to be applied to future obligations[63]). A major change came in 2020: under a new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP 2020), India diluted its offset requirements by exempting many deals - specifically government-to-government agreements, intergovernmental deals, and single-vendor contracts - from offset obligations[64][65]. Since most big-ticket purchases (like Rafale fighters from France) fell under these categories, this effectively rolls back the offset mandate for those cases, in an effort to reduce procurement costs and address the poor performance of offsets so far[66][67]. Critics argue this move virtually “scraps” the offset policy and gives up a key opportunity for tech transfer[64][68], while the government cited a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report showing underachievement of past offsets.\nAims: India’s offsets are principally aimed at developing an indigenous defence industrial base and technological self-reliance[52]. The official objectives are to foster internationally competitive enterprises in India, boost defence R&D and manufacturing capability, and spur co-development of new technologies[52]. Strategically, India wants to become less dependent on foreign arms; offsets were seen as a way to obtain advanced know-how (e.g. aircraft avionics, radar, missile tech) and to integrate Indian companies into global supply chains. There is also an economic aim: using defence imports as a catalyst for high-tech jobs, exports, and skill development (aligning with India’s broader “Make in India” initiative). Notably, India prohibited pure indirect civilian offsets, reflecting that the priority was military-relevant industry growth, not general trade deals[26]. Offsets also serve a political purpose: they help justify to the public and parliament why India is spending billions on foreign weapons - by showing that part of that money is reinvested domestically (addressing the long-standing pressure to achieve defence indigenization)[7].\nMechanisms: Under India’s regime, foreign vendors fulfill offsets via several mechanisms. A primary mode is co-production or purchase of sub-systems: the foreign company agrees to source components, assemblies, or services from Indian manufacturers (Indian Offset Partners, IOPs) for the main platform[62]. For example, if India buys helicopters, the supplier might place contracts with Indian firms to produce avionics or engine parts worth 30% of the deal. Another mechanism is direct investment and joint ventures in India’s defence sector - foreign OEMs can earn offset credits by investing in Indian companies or forming JV partnerships to produce weapon systems locally[62]. Technology transfer was added as an eligible mechanism in 2012, with a bonus multiplier (up to 3x credit for high-value tech) to incentivize genuine knowledge transfer[69]. India also allows offsets via funding R&D projects in approved institutions[70]. Initially, India did not allow offset banking, but later iterations permitted vendors to bank offset credits (for up to 7 years) for future use[63]. Offset agreements in India are typically complex and involve years of implementation, with the Ministry of Defence monitoring annual progress and imposing penalties (up to 5-10% of contract value) for shortfalls. In practice, foreign firms often partner with a web of Indian small and medium enterprises to discharge obligations, given limitations of any single local firm to absorb huge contracts[71].\nOutcomes and Challenges: India’s offset program has had mixed results. On one hand, it did stimulate some local industry growth: an aerospace manufacturing ecosystem around Bangalore benefited from offset-related work, contributing to a dramatic rise in India’s aerospace exports from a mere \\$62 million in 2005 to about \\$6.7 billion by 2014[72]. This suggests offsets helped Indian firms integrate into global supply chains (e.g. producing aircraft parts for major OEMs) and made India one of the top 10 exporters in that segment[73]. On the other hand, multiple audits and studies have been scathing about the effectiveness of Indian offsets. A CAG audit of 2007-2013 offset contracts found significant non-compliance - 5 of 16 contracts examined did not meet policy conditions, with offsets accepted that provided no real value-add to Indian partners (essentially paper transactions)[74][75]. Enforcement was lax: the MoD often failed to levy penalties on defaulters[76]. By 2020, out of ₹66,000 crore (≈\\$9.3B) in signed offset obligations, only 8% (₹5,500 crore) had been realized, and crucially “not a single case” of high-tech transfer was achieved according to the CAG[77]. These are sobering figures. Foreign vendors sometimes struggled to find qualified Indian partners or projects, leading to offsets being fulfilled via low-tech or indirect means (like simple purchase of services) that didn’t build new capability[78][74]. There have also been corruption concerns: though not always directly tied to offsets, India’s defence deals (e.g. AgustaWestland helicopters, or the offset partner selection in the Rafale deal) have faced allegations that offset partner choices or agreements were influenced by cronyism. The opacity and complexity of offset contracts can provide cover for such dealings, a risk highlighted by transparency advocates[15][16].\nContext: India’s case underscores the challenge of implementing offsets in a bureaucracy-heavy environment with relatively nascent industry. The country’s pressing security needs (importing modern arms to counter China/Pakistan) gave it buyer leverage, but also urgency that sometimes led the government to waive or water down offsets (as seen in 2020) to avoid delays. Indian industry’s absorptive capacity constraints have been a recurring theme - many Indian companies simply were not technologically ready to absorb cutting-edge production, limiting the impact of offsets[78]. Still, the policy did catalyze the entry of India’s private sector into defence production and encouraged joint ventures (e.g. Tata, Mahindra, L&T teaming with global firms). The recent dilution of offset requirements suggests a strategic re-think: New Delhi may now be focusing more on direct indigenous development programs and higher FDI limits in defence, rather than relying on the offset clause, which had not met expectations. The India case demonstrates both the potential (billions of dollars in domestic work generated) and pitfalls (bureaucratic hurdles, lack of high-tech transfer, compliance issues) of a large mandatory offset regime.\n\n\n3.2 Saudi Arabia\nTimeline and Policy: Saudi Arabia was one of the early adopters of formal offsets in the Middle East. Its Economic Offset Program (EOP) was launched in the mid-1980s (around 1984-85) amid major arms deals like the UK’s Al-Yamamah agreement[79][80]. The program set a requirement that foreign defense contractors invest a portion of the contract value in Saudi joint ventures and projects. Initially the offset obligation was on the order of 30%, later standardized to ~35% of the contract’s value (specifically the value of the technical equipment/services) to be reinvested in Saudi Arabia[50]. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Saudi Arabia continued to include offset clauses in most large purchases (from U.S. AWACS and Peace Shield systems to European fighter jets). The EOP was managed by a dedicated committee that evaluated and approved offset projects. By the 2010s, offsets became part of the broader economic strategy: Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, announced in 2016, explicitly aims to localize over 50% of defence procurement spending by 2030, effectively using offsets and localization requirements to build a domestic military-industrial sector. There have been reforms to streamline and expand offset guidelines - for example, coordination with the UAE was discussed to allow joint offset projects in either country counting toward obligations[81]. In recent years, Saudi offset policy has been complemented by direct government investment in defence industry (e.g. the creation of SAMI, the Saudi Arabian Military Industries state company, in 2017), but offsets remain a key tool to force foreign suppliers into local partnerships.\nPrimary Aims: Saudi Arabia’s offset regime has been industrial-economic in nature with a strategic tinge. The government’s goal was to leverage massive defence spending to diversify the economy and create skilled employment for Saudis, reducing over-reliance on oil[49]. Offsets were seen as a way to acquire technology and know-how by piggybacking on defence deals - building industries in areas like aerospace, electronics, communications, and other high-tech fields that the Kingdom lacked. An official objective was to become a knowledge-driven economy, so offsets extended into training and education initiatives as well[82][54]. Strategically, Saudi Arabia did not seek full self-sufficiency in arms (it remains heavily import-dependent), but having some local production and maintenance capability was intended to improve security of supply and perhaps give the Kingdom political leverage (e.g. local ventures tie Western firms and by extension their governments closer to Saudi security interests). Another aim, especially in recent years, is local content - ensuring that a portion of the value of contracts “stays” in Saudi, stimulating domestic suppliers and contractors (much like an economic offset for the huge outflow of funds on imports).\nMechanisms: The Saudi EOP primarily uses joint ventures (JVs) as the mechanism for offsets[50]. Foreign defense companies are required to invest in new Saudi-incorporated ventures (often partnering with local investors or institutions) in designated sectors. These JVs might produce defense-related products (like parts, munitions, or spares), or non-defense goods that help diversify the industrial base. The offset rules also emphasize local content in subcontracting - foreign primes and even their subcontractors must give preference to Saudi suppliers where possible[83]. Over the years, dozens of ventures were created: examples include aircraft maintenance centers, a glycols chemical plant, advanced materials factories, and training academies. In one notable offset project, Boeing in 1985 set up the Boeing Industrial Technology Group to fulfill Peace Shield radar system offset obligations, which engaged in technology training and later partnerships in Saudi education[54][84]. The British Offset Office, a UK-Saudi joint body, helped channel offsets from UK contracts into ventures like a polymer production plant (Synthomer Middle East, founded 1996 through an offset JV)[51]. Indirect offsets in civil sectors have also been allowed - such as investments in petrochemicals, telecom, or power infrastructure - as long as they create high-tech jobs for Saudis. To encourage compliance, Saudi Arabia built in penalties and also the incentive of follow-on contracts: companies that successfully established local presence via offsets often gained favor in subsequent deals (e.g. Boeing’s deepened ties after its offset group led to further fighter sales)[54]. Recent policy has looked to coordinate offsets with other Gulf countries (like the UAE) and focus on projects aligned with national priorities (e.g. localization of ammo production, drone technology, etc.)[81].\nOutcomes and Evaluation: Saudi Arabia’s offset program has yielded a mixed but notable legacy. By 2006, the EOP had facilitated the creation of 36 companies with total capitalization of \\$4.5 billion, and by the mid-2010s over 40 joint ventures were in place[85][86]. These ventures spanned sectors from aerospace (e.g. Alsalam Aircraft Company for aircraft maintenance) to food processing (oddly, a dairy farm was once an offset project) and helped employ around 6,500 Saudi nationals by 2006[87]. However, relative to the scale of Saudi defence spending, these achievements were modest - between 1985 and 2006 Saudi spent an estimated \\$150 billion on arms, which should have produced \\$45-55 billion in offsets if the 30-35% rule was fully enforced, yet only \\$4.5 billion materialized as offset capital[88][89]. This implies many offsets were waived, delayed or under-delivered (a common issue where suppliers negotiate down actual obligations). The effectiveness of offsets in truly diversifying the economy has been uneven. Some success stories exist: for example, the Advanced Electronics Company (AEC), founded via offset in 1988 with US help, grew into a leading local defense electronics firm. But many other offset companies struggled once the initial obligation was met - a study noted that offset-founded firms often remained narrow in scope, doing contract manufacturing only for the specific offset and failing to become competitive beyond that[90]. In other words, a company set up to assemble one subsystem under offset might not innovate or win other business after the original offset contract ends[91]. Recognizing this, consultants like A.T. Kearney have advised Saudi to incentivize more sustainable ventures and ensure local partners invest in long-term capability, possibly by structuring JVs so that the foreign firm can eventually exit after transferring know-how[92][93].\nStrategically, Saudi offsets have not (yet) created an autonomous arms industry for front-line equipment - the Kingdom still imports virtually all major platforms. But it has gained capacity in maintenance, overhaul and some production of less complex items (armored vehicles, ammunition, UAVs with foreign help, etc.). By the late 2010s, Saudi Arabia was cited as the world’s largest offsets market, forecast to account for ~15% of global military offset obligations, reflecting the sheer volume of its arms imports and offset demands[94]. The Saudi government has become more assertive that future deals must involve localization - for instance, recent purchases of naval ships and aircraft include conditions for local assembly or partnership with SAMI. One could say offsets laid the groundwork for the current push toward defence industrialization under Vision 2030.\nCorruption and Governance: Saudi offset dealings, particularly the Al-Yamamah program with BAE, became infamous for corruption allegations. Investigations in the UK in the 2000s suggested that some payments labeled as “offset services” were actually bribes to Saudi officials, leading to a major scandal (though the UK’s Serious Fraud Office ultimately dropped the case after political pressure). This underscores a vulnerability: the opacity of offset projects (like a gratuitous investment in a unrelated venture) can be used to cloak illicit commissions[95]. Saudi Arabia has since implemented more compliance measures and hired consultancies to audit offset performance, but transparency remains low by international standards. The political economy of offsets in the Kingdom meant that often members of the royal family or well-connected businessmen were stakeholders in the JV companies created, raising questions about who truly benefited. Nonetheless, some analysts argue the offset program did produce positive externalities by exposing local businesses to international partners and raising standards, if not as much as hoped[86][53].\nIn summary, Saudi Arabia’s offset regime illustrates a long-term, well-funded attempt to trade petrodollars for industrial development. It has had partial success in building supporting industries and is now being ramped up into an even more ambitious localization drive. But it also highlights classic offset challenges: under-delivery relative to promises, difficulty in sustaining ventures post-obligation, and potential misuse. The Kingdom is now coupling offsets with stronger state-led investment to try to realize its defence industrial dreams.\n\n\n3.3 United Arab Emirates (UAE)\nTimeline and Policy: The UAE, like Saudi, established its offset program in the early 1990s. In 1992, under the guidance of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (then Chief of Staff, now President), the UAE founded the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) to manage offset projects[96][85]. The program was formally known as the Tawazun Economic Program (Tawazun meaning “balance” in Arabic). Initially, the UAE mandated that foreign defense suppliers reinvest a substantial portion (commonly 60% of the contract value) into profitable projects in the Emirates. This high percentage was notable - one of the most demanding globally. Over the years, the UOG facilitated numerous joint ventures and investments. In 2007, the program was rebranded: UOG became the Tawazun Economic Council in a 20th anniversary revamp[97][36], signaling continuity but a fresh image. In 2015, the UAE updated its offset policy guidelines, and again in 2019, issuing a revised policy that broadened the scope of offsets and adjusted mechanisms[98]. The 2019 Tawazun Guidelines introduced more flexibility in project selection (including non-defense “strategic sectors”) and set default timelines for offset project completion (typically 7 years)[99][100]. Today, the Tawazun Council remains a central player in UAE defense procurement, integrating offsets with the country’s national economic and technology goals.\nObjectives: The UAE’s offset program is explicitly tied to its national development strategy. Key aims include: economic diversification, moving beyond oil by building up industries such as aerospace, precision manufacturing, technology and renewables[101]; developing a local defence sector for greater self-reliance and high-value exports[102]; creating a knowledge-based economy with skilled employment for UAE citizens (Emiratization of the workforce)[103][104]; and addressing strategic priorities like food and water security, sustainability, and infrastructure via offset investment[105]. In short, the UAE sees offsets as a tool to align defence spending with broader economic and strategic imperatives. For example, offsets have been directed into setting up aerospace manufacturing (to support both defence and civil aviation) and into dual-use technologies that can spin off civilian benefits. This reflects both industrial aims (jobs, local companies) and strategic aims (having domestic capability in critical areas and securing foreign partnerships). Another implicit aim is to integrate the UAE into global high-tech supply chains, enhancing its international profile (the UAE wants to be known not just as an arms buyer but as a producer and innovator in certain niches).\nMechanisms: The Tawazun Economic Program requires any defense contract over a certain threshold to incur an offset obligation (commonly 60% of contract value historically, adjusted in new guidelines). Foreign contractors fulfill this by proposing offset projects which are vetted and approved by Tawazun Council. Mechanisms include: establishing joint ventures with local partners (the foreign company invests capital or technology, a local entity contributes some capital/effort, and a new company is formed in the UAE); making direct investments (e.g. building a new factory or R&D center); or executing specific capability development programs (such as training Emiratis, creating internship programs, or transferring know-how to local institutions). Credits are awarded based on the value added in the UAE - and the 2019 policy introduced a credit multipliers system to incentivize projects in priority sectors (like a project in advanced technology or one that strongly integrates Emirati employees might earn extra credit)[105][106]. The program also uses an “offset bank” concept: companies can undertake projects even when not immediately required, banking credits for future obligations, which encourages continuous engagement. Tawazun operates by reviewing concept papers from contractors, approving viable projects, and then monitoring implementation over multi-year periods[107]. If obligations are not met in time, penalties or “buy-outs” apply (firms must pay money in lieu of unfulfilled offsets).\nOver nearly three decades, the UAE’s offsets have created a number of prominent companies: Abu Dhabi Ship Building (originally an offset with CMN of France), NIMR Automotive (building military vehicles, started via offset), Caracal International (small arms manufacturer), and more recently the conglomerate EDGE Group (formed in 2019 by consolidating 25 local defense/tech firms, many of which had offset origins). Tawazun also invested in non-defense sectors, such as banking (an offset led to the creation of an Islamic bank in the 1990s) and real estate, but the modern focus is more on strategic industries. Uniquely, the UAE also allowed regional cooperation: in 2019, officials from UAE and Saudi discussed that a foreign firm could get offset credit in both countries for a single joint project established in one - aiming to attract bigger projects that benefit the broader region[81].\nOutcomes: The UAE’s offset program is often cited as one of the more successful, albeit backed by the country’s strong finances and governance. By 2012, the Tawazun Council reported that it had attracted over 40 joint ventures through offsets since inception[85]. These ventures have contributed to the UAE now having a fledgling but growing defense manufacturing base. For example, the UAE can produce armored vehicles (NIMR), guided munitions, naval vessels (through Abu Dhabi Ship Building), and firearms - things that in 1990 it had zero capability for. The program has also undeniably created high-skilled jobs for Emiratis, though exact figures are not publicly disclosed. One measure of outcome: export generation - some offset-born companies are exporting abroad (EDGE’s subsidiary AL Tariq sells guided bombs, for instance). The 2019 broadening of offsets to areas like food security and education technology[105] suggests the UAE sees enough capacity in pure defense that offsets can now also help other strategic sectors.\nChallenges remain, however. Technology transfer is still sometimes limited by foreign licensing (U.S. export controls have prevented some advanced tech transfers the UAE wanted[108]). Ensuring intellectual property ownership in joint projects can be tricky (foreign partners may be wary of giving up IP)[109]. Additionally, finding qualified local talent (engineers, technicians) to employ in high-tech offset projects is an ongoing challenge in the UAE[104], given its small population and skills gap - leading to heavy reliance on expatriates, which partially defeats the purpose of knowledge localization. To mitigate this, offsets often include training and education components for citizens. The UAE’s drive to become a regional defense hub (exemplified by hosting the big IDEX and Dubai Airshow events) is bolstered by offsets, but ultimately the commercial viability of offset companies is a test: some ventures have thrived, others have shuttered once offset credits were earned. The UAE tends to mitigate this by government support or by folding companies into larger groups like EDGE for efficiency. Transparency is moderate - foreign companies have generally praised the UAE’s offset process as businesslike, but details of projects are not always disclosed due to strategic and commercial secrecy.\nIn conclusion, the UAE offset regime shows how a country can methodically harness defence trade for wider development goals. With high-level backing and continuous policy refinement, it has arguably achieved a “balance” (true to its name) between defence and economic interests better than many others. As the UAE moves forward, offsets will likely remain central to its plans to domesticate 50%+ of its defense procurement and to cultivate home-grown defense champions.\n\n\n3.4 Turkey (Turkiye)\nPolicy Evolution: Turkey has pursued defence industrialization since the 1970s, and offsets have been a cornerstone of that strategy. By the late 1980s, Turkey instituted a formal offset policy for foreign arms purchases, motivated in part by a U.S. arms embargo in 1975 that exposed its vulnerability. A landmark was the F-16 Peace Onyx program (initiated 1984) where Turkey co-produced F-16 fighters with U.S. assistance - essentially a direct offset deal that led to the creation of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI)[110]. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Turkey mandated offsets (often minimum 50% of contract value) on major buys like tanks, helicopters, and missiles. The Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (SSM, now Presidency of Defence Industries) managed these programs. In the 2000s, Turkey shifted from just license production to requiring more technology transfer and local development in offsets - e.g. insisting on source code access for software, or local assembly of complex systems (like the F-15 and F-35 component production). Turkey’s offset approach blurred into its co-development ventures: e.g. Turkey partnered on the F-35 JSF not simply to buy the jet but to be a manufacturing partner (with Turkish firms producing parts of every F-35)[53]. This is effectively an offset outcome achieved by joining a multinational program. As of the 2010s, Turkey’s policy evolved to “Industrial Participation/Co-production” requirements in all big contracts, with flexibility in how companies meet them. More recently, as Turkey’s own industry has grown, it has less need for traditional offsets when importing (since it imports less and often prefers local products), and in fact Turkey itself as an exporter now offers offsets to its customers (for example, offering Pakistan technology share in drone sales). Still, for high-tech acquisitions like long-range air defense or engines that Turkey still needs from abroad, it continues to demand localized production and tech sharing.\nAims: Turkey’s offset and localization efforts have been driven by a strong quest for strategic autonomy. The overarching aim is to develop a robust national defence industry capable of designing and producing a wide range of military hardware - so that Turkey can reduce or eliminate reliance on foreign suppliers (especially crucial after events like arms embargoes or strained relations with allies). Offsets were a means to import knowledge and manufacturing skills. The industrial aim is also significant: building up indigenous companies (Aselsan in electronics, Roketsan in missiles, TAI in aerospace, etc.), creating jobs for Turkish engineers and technicians, and eventually turning Turkey into a defence exporter. Indeed, Turkey often cites South Korea and Israel as models - using offsets to climb the tech ladder[53]. A secondary political aim was to leverage its large orders to ensure alliance support - e.g. by involving American and European companies in local ventures, Turkey increased its interdependence with those allies.\nMechanisms: Turkey employed a comprehensive set of offset mechanisms, mostly on the direct offset side. These include: Licensed production - Turkey produced under license American systems like F-16s, German submarines, etc., gaining production skills; Technology transfer and co-development - foreign firms were pressed to share designs and set up R&D collaboration (for instance, Turkey’s MILGEM warship program had foreign advisors but local design input); Local content requirements - big projects mandated a certain % of parts sourced from Turkish subcontractors or final assembly in Turkey. Turkey also used offset credits for civilian exports: a foreign vendor could discharge offset obligations by helping Turkish industry export goods abroad (reverse purchases). Over time, Turkey became savvy in negotiating high-value work packages: e.g. as part of an order for utility helicopters, it negotiated setting up a local helicopter assembly line and manufacturing of specific components that could be exported to other customers by the Turkish plant. Another mechanism was training and know-how: foreign partners trained Turkish engineers, and many Turkish engineers were embedded in foreign factories to learn (particularly during F-16 and later programs). The SSM/SSB tracked offset fulfillment closely, and Turkey often structured deals so that final payments depended on offset fulfillment (to enforce compliance). The country also set up defence industrial zones to host joint production (like TAI’s facility in Ankara).\nOutcomes: Turkey’s use of offsets and insistence on local production has been regarded as a relative success story. From near-total dependence on imports in the 1980s, Turkey by the 2020s could produce many of its own arms: tactical drones (Bayraktar TB2, Anka), trainer jets (Hurkus), a forthcoming 5th-gen fighter prototype (TF-X), warships, tanks (the Altay, albeit with foreign engine issues), and a range of electronics and missile systems. This transformation was fueled by the technology and industrial capabilities gained through decades of offsets and partnerships. For example, TAI building F-16s gave it the expertise to later develop indigenous aircraft structures; joint projects with European missile makers contributed to Turkey’s own missile programs. Turkey’s defence exports topped \\$3 billion annually by the early 2020s, making it a notable arms exporter - something virtually unthinkable before. Offsets also embedded Turkey’s firms in global supply chains (TAI and Roketsan supplied parts to the F-35 program until Turkey’s suspension in 2019, and numerous Turkish companies are suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, etc., partly thanks to offset-induced certifications). Domestically, tens of thousands of jobs in Turkey’s defence sector can be traced back to industrial participation projects that started under offsets since the 1990s.\nHowever, not all has been smooth. Challenges included occasional disputes over technology (for instance, the U.S. has sometimes refused source code transfers or the sharing of specific sensitive tech which Turkey requested as part of offsets). Also, Turkey’s ambition sometimes outpaced what offsets delivered - e.g. having license-produced F-16s did not mean Turkey could design a jet engine; true self-reliance in certain subsystems (like engines, radar) still required additional investment and time. There have been cases where offset projects failed commercially when protected domestic orders dried up. Additionally, after Turkey’s purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, it was removed from the F-35 program - a setback that shows limits of relying on an offset partnership as a guarantee (geopolitics can intervene). But Turkey responded by doubling down on its own development.\nOverall, Turkey leveraged offsets in a very strategic manner, using them as stepping stones to an indigenous industry. The country is now close to fielding an entirely home-produced suite of defence products. It demonstrates that with political will, a clear vision, and a relatively large domestic market to leverage (Turkey’s armed forces), offsets can indeed contribute to genuine industrial and strategic gains. Turkey’s case is often contrasted with others where offsets stayed at assembly-level work; Turkey managed to climb the value chain significantly.\n\n\n3.5 South Korea\nPolicy Background: South Korea has long pursued local production of foreign weapons under license (dating back to the 1970s), but formal offsets became prominent in the 1990s as Korea made major high-tech acquisitions. Seoul’s approach, like Turkey’s, was motivated by the desire to build a domestic defence industry under the umbrella of the U.S.-ROK alliance. By the early 1990s, South Korea instituted an offset requirement for foreign defense contracts (often around 30-50% of contract value). For example, during Korea’s F-X fighter competitions (F-15K in 2002, F-35 later), the government explicitly scored bids on their offset proposals, and bidders offered substantial tech transfer and co-production. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), formed in 2006, oversees offsets as part of its acquisition strategy. In recent years, South Korea’s stance on offsets has fluctuated: after a 2018 audit that pointed out some inefficiencies, there was internal debate about scrapping mandatory offsets[111]. Indeed, from 2014 onwards, Korea appeared to reduce its offset demands, especially on purchases from the U.S. via Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs, to avoid delaying deals or due to U.S. reluctance[112]. South Korea even briefly suspended its legal requirement in some cases, focusing more on direct commercial partnerships. However, as Korean industry now aspires to be a top global arms exporter, there are calls to reinforce offsets again to ensure any imports still contribute to local industry[113][114]. So Korea’s offset policy is in a dynamic state - historically crucial, then eased off, and possibly to be strengthened in a targeted way.\nAims: The aims of Korean offsets were dual: industrial development and strategic defense capability. On the industrial side, South Korea saw offsets as a way to acquire advanced manufacturing techniques and integrate its chaebol (conglomerates) into the aerospace and defense supply chains. This was part of the broader economic strategy of climbing the tech ladder (the same model Korea used in electronics and automotive - learn from foreign partners then indigenize). On the strategic side, the goal was to eventually produce most of the weaponry needed to equip Korean forces, giving Seoul more autonomy especially vis-à-vis North Korea’s threat. This included being able to export arms for economic and diplomatic benefit. Another implicit aim was to ensure technology transfer that could spill over into civilian high-tech sectors (e.g. aerospace know-how benefitting commercial aviation or space programs). Offsets also helped justify large defense purchases politically: the Korean public could accept multi-billion deals if they were told it would result in factories and jobs in Korea and reduce dependency on U.S. support over time.\nMechanisms: South Korea’s offsets heavily emphasized technology transfer, local production, and licensed manufacturing. During the KF-16 program in the mid-90s (Korea’s localization of F-16s), Lockheed Martin provided technical data and kits for Samsung Aerospace (now KAI) to assemble 72 of the 140 F-16s in Korea - a direct offset that established jet production capability. Korea also negotiated offsets like production of parts for export: e.g. as part of E-737 AWACS aircraft purchase from Boeing, Korean firms got contracts to produce aerospace components for Boeing’s civil aircraft, fulfilling offset obligations through reverse exports. Often, offsets were tied to specific technology packages - foreign suppliers had to train Korean engineers or help set up R&D labs. One prominent example: the FX-II fighter (F-15K) deal in 2002 included transfer of aerospace manufacturing techniques and even cooperation to help Korea develop its own supersonic trainer (which became the T-50 Golden Eagle). Another mechanism was the Korean Industry Participation requirement: foreign contractors had to subcontract a percentage of work to Korean defense companies. South Korea also adeptly used competitive leverage - in open competitions (like for helicopters in 2013), it made offset offers a major factor, effectively compelling bidders to outbid each other in tech transfer.\nBy the 2010s, South Korea had acquired enough domestic base that it sometimes opted to forgo offsets on off-the-shelf buys in favor of speed (for instance, it bought some P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft from the U.S. without significant offsets because it urgently needed them). But concurrently, it launched big indigenous projects (KF-X fighter, K2 tank, etc.) often seeded by knowledge gained from prior offset collaborations.\nOutcomes: South Korea is frequently cited as an offset success, similar to Turkey. It has achieved substantial self-reliance: today, Korean-made equipment (from submarines to howitzers to aircraft) forms a large share of its military inventory. Offsets in the 90s and 00s directly contributed to building companies like Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and Hanwha Defense (formerly Daewoo, Samsung tech divisions) into globally competitive players. For instance, the development of the T-50 advanced trainer jet - the first supersonic aircraft built by South Korea - was made possible by technology and expertise accumulated from licensed F-16 production and offsets from F-15K deals. Similarly, Samsung Techwin’s production of K9 Thunder howitzers benefitted from tech-sharing when buying foreign artillery. Korea’s approach of requiring foreign suppliers to purchase Korean-made subcomponents as offsets also helped its SMEs enter international supply chains. By 2020, South Korea’s defense exports boomed (selling aircraft to Southeast Asia, tanks to Europe, howitzers to many countries, etc.), approaching the top tier of global arms exporters[6]. This remarkable rise (nearly \\$3-4B in annual exports) is rooted partly in offset-driven capacity-building.\nHowever, Korea’s offset story also has cautionary notes. The 2018 audit by Korea’s Board of Audit and Inspection found that some offsets were not delivering desired results - noting that while offsets yielded nearly \\$8 billion in benefits from 2011-2015, they dropped to only \\$800 million from 2016-2020 as policies shifted[112][111]. The decline was due to multiple factors: reluctance to strain US relations by demanding offsets in FMS deals (like for the F-35), and internal disagreements on how aggressive to be[111]. This indicates that as South Korea became an American security partner of greater importance, it sometimes chose strategic alliance considerations over maximizing offsets (essentially supplier pressure in this case: the US views excessive offsets as a trade barrier[115]). The recommendation now from Korean experts is that Korea shouldn’t abandon offsets entirely if it wants to be one of the top defense exporters - rather it should maintain a smart offset policy to continue upgrading its capabilities[113][114].\nAnother challenge is saturation: as Korean industry matures, simply assembling foreign designs brings diminishing returns - Korea now seeks true co-development (as with the KF-X fighter with some help from Lockheed). There have been some disappointments, like technology that was promised but not delivered due to export restrictions (e.g. the US reportedly denied transfer of certain F-35 technologies Korea hoped to receive, forcing Korea to develop them domestically). In sum, though, South Korea’s use of offsets and local content requirements unquestionably accelerated its journey from an arms importer to an emerging arms exporter. It shows how offsets, aligned with a national strategy and backed by consistent investment in education and infrastructure, can pay off.\n\n\n3.6 Western Countries: NATO & EU Members, Canada, Australia\nMost Western developed countries are arms exporters and thus don’t usually impose offsets as buyers (since they rarely import major systems they can’t produce). However, many medium-sized Western nations that do import have had offset policies, and even the major powers have practiced forms of industrial benefits in special cases.\nIn Europe, during the Cold War and 1990s, it was common for countries to require offsets on big purchases. For example, Greece and Portugal in the 1990s-2000s had offset requirements upward of 100% for fighter and submarine deals - which unfortunately became notorious for corruption. A Transparency International study highlights that Greece’s and Portugal’s offset programs in that era were marred by bribery scandals (e.g. the German submarine sale to Portugal in 2004 involved massive offsets but also later corruption trials)[116]. These cases show the risk when governance is weak: officials can be swayed to accept inflated offset deals in exchange for kickbacks, with little actual benefit to the economy. Central and Eastern European countries, upon joining NATO in the 2000s, also employed offsets to help their struggling industries adapt. Poland’s 2003 law, as noted, mandated 100% offsets for the \\$3.5B F-16 deal[18]. Lockheed’s fulfillment of this (through offset projects like manufacturing aircraft parts, developing an IT park, etc.) was initially hailed as a win[11]. Poland credits the F-16 offsets with injecting new technology and export opportunities - Polish defense suppliers became part of Lockheed’s global supply chain, and some civilian projects (like an aviation training center) were launched. However, an assessment a decade later found not all promised investments fully materialized and some jobs were short-lived. After the EU Directive 2009/81/EC, Poland and others had to phase out the formal offset mandate[41], but they still negotiate industrial cooperation for each deal (Poland’s recent purchases of Patriot missiles and F-35s included significant local workshare, though not termed “offsets” officially).\nMajor NATO countries like the UK, France, Germany rarely use the term “offset”, but they ensure domestic industry involvement via other means. For example, the British when buying the American F-35 became a Tier-1 development partner, securing significant production work for UK industry (British companies build ~15% of each F-35) - effectively an industrial benefit arrangement akin to offsets, but structured as partnership. France almost always buys domestically or jointly develops (so offsets as such don’t apply since they favor domestic procurement). Germany similarly often co-develops (e.g. with European partners) or, if buying off-the-shelf, might request some final assembly domestically (as it did for some UAV imports). Italy and Spain have used offsets when buying from the US - for instance, Italy’s C-130J purchase in early 2000s had an offset involving Italian firms making subassemblies for Lockheed.\nThe EU’s crackdown on formal offsets means that since 2010, any EU member’s defence ministry can’t explicitly make offset a tender award criterion (except under national security exception)[42][41]. Instead, they use terms like “industrial return” or require bidders to include a plan for local involvement (subject to separate negotiation). Despite this, informal offsets persist in Europe - especially with non-EU suppliers. For example, Finland and Switzerland (not EU, but Western) demanded heavy offsets for their fighter jet buys in the 1990s. Even in 2021, Finland’s \\$9B F-35 purchase included industrial cooperation commitments (like engine maintenance facility in Finland) though Finland avoided calling it offsets due to EU rules.\nCanada has one of the oldest offset regimes among Western nations, known historically as Industrial & Regional Benefits (IRB). Since 1986, Canada required that any major defence procurement from foreign suppliers results in investments in Canada equal to the contract value (100% offset)[117]. This was partly to appease domestic politics - ensuring all regions of Canada got economic spin-offs from big purchases (for instance, the CF-18 fighter buy in the 1980s brought aerospace work to multiple provinces). In 2014, Canada revamped IRB into the Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) policy[118]. The ITB policy still mandates 100% economic benefit, but now puts emphasis on priority areas and a “value proposition” where bidders are graded on how their proposal will provide long-term technological benefit to Canada[119]. The outcomes have been significant in sustaining Canada’s aerospace industry: companies like Magellan and CAE grew through offset-related subcontracts (making components for Airbus, Boeing, etc., as a result of past offset obligations). However, critics note that many IRB projects were essentially indirect offsets (investments in auto parts or other industries) that did not build a self-sufficient defence industry. Canada still relies on imports for most major systems, but it has carved a niche in training simulators, avionics, and space tech, thanks in part to past offsets. Notably, Canada’s policy is very formal and transparent - companies regularly report their Canadian content and investments, and there are even cases of companies over-performing (exceeding offset requirements) to win favor for future deals[120].\nAustralia historically did not use the term offsets as mentioned, but in earlier decades it had an “Australian Industry Involvement” policy for defence. In the 2000s, it shifted to the AIC (Australian Industry Capability) framework, requiring bidders to outline how they will include Australian suppliers. The government does not set a fixed percentage, but major projects like the F-35, P-8, and naval ship builds have seen substantial local work content (e.g. Australia locally builds parts of the F-35 and will build most of its new frigates domestically). The Australian stance is that strict offsets add cost premiums of 5-20%, which they want to avoid[40], but at the same time they invest heavily in domestic capability through other means (like teaming arrangements and direct subsidies to industry).\nIn summary, Western countries’ experience with offsets is varied: some smaller nations that are net importers have used them to support their economies (with mixed success), whereas larger defence producers focus more on partnership and co-development. Many Western governments share the view that while offsets can bring short-term jobs, they can also distort the market and raise prices[12][40]. This is why bodies like the WTO and EU discourage them. Even the United States, the world’s top arms exporter, has an official policy that views offsets as “market distorting” - but U.S. companies nonetheless engage in offsets because not doing so would mean losing contracts to European or other competitors who will offer them[45][121]. The U.S. requires contractors to report all offset agreements to the Department of Commerce, which publishes an annual report on offsets in defense trade (indicating tens of billions in obligations are active at any time)[122]. That data shows U.S. firms from 1993-2012 entered about \\$70B in offset agreements, mainly to Europe and the Middle East[122].\nThus, even in Western supplier nations, offsets have indirectly shaped the industry by pushing companies to globalize their supply chains - sometimes outsourcing work to the buying country’s factories (which in some cases are subsidiaries or joint ventures of the same company). The line between offsets and normal business blurs here, echoing Hall and Markowski’s point that an offset is ultimately a part of a larger complex transaction[123][124]. The difference is perspective: economists may frown upon it, but as long as buyer governments “universally acknowledge” their benefits in securing domestic political support[125], offsets or their equivalents will remain a fixture of defence procurement.\nHaving reviewed these cases, we can draw comparisons across countries. The following table summarizes major offset regimes, highlighting their introduction, key features, aims, and mechanisms.",

    "text": "3 Realist synthesis coding (CMO)\n\n3.1 CMO 1: Buyer leverage in a “buyer’s market” drives deeper technology demands\n\nContext: Global arms market characterised as increasingly buyer-favoured; multiple suppliers competing for prestige mega-deals (e.g., India MMRCA).\nMechanism: Buyers specify high offset shares and extensive ToT/licence manufacture to convert procurement into industrial capability-building.\nOutcome: Suppliers normalise technology sharing as “evil necessity”; offset policies are revised iteratively to maximise feasible extraction of technology/industrial benefits.\n\n\n\n3.2 CMO 2: Interoperability requires sharing—yet core “black box” remains protected\n\nContext: Multinational development/partnering (F-35) aimed at interoperability with allies, cost reduction, and political alignment.\nMechanism: US shares selected sensitive technologies to support interoperability and partner ROI, but retains control over the most critical enabling technology (source code; key stealth elements) through disclosure policy/export control constraints.\nOutcome: Partners gain participation and some technology/workshare, but remain dependent followers at the leading edge; recurring friction over limited access and restricted tech sharing.\n\n\n\n3.3 CMO 3: Small-producer survival strategy depends on co-development + permissive ToT offers\n\nContext: Smaller producers (Saab) face limited domestic orders and must export; advanced next-gen upgrades require shared development finance.\nMechanism: Supplier offers generous industrial packages and potential source-code/technology access to overcome non-US status and platform disadvantages.\nOutcome: Some competitiveness gains but no guarantee of success; capability fit and geopolitical weight can override industrial/technology incentives (e.g., Norway choosing F-35).\n\n\n\n3.4 CMO 4: Offset-policy liberalisation trades off defence-industrial strengthening vs feasibility\n\nContext: High defence-only offset shares difficult to meet in limited domestic defence markets; suppliers press for broader eligible offset categories.\nMechanism: Policy revisions broaden eligible offsets (civil aerospace/internal security), consider ToT as eligible offsets, multipliers, and enhanced monitoring/banking.\nOutcome: Increased supplier feasibility and potential broader economic benefits, but risk of diluting direct strengthening of the domestic military industrial base.",
