### Article summaries and RQ relevance scoring

For each article, a short summary is followed by scores (1 = high relevance; 0.5 = partial; 0 = not relevant) for each research question with brief justification.

#### **Achmadi (2025)** – *Forced autonomy model for Indonesia’s defence industrialisation*

**Summary:** The article argues that Indonesia’s reliance on licensed assembly is transactional because offset and technology‑transfer clauses are absent. It recommends mandatory technology transfer for deals over USD 50 million and highlights positive foreign examples—South Korea, Turkey and Singapore—that embed co‑production and SME integration. The article also warns that rigid enforcement can cause bureaucratic overload.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Discusses supply‑chain integration and readiness indirectly (mandatory technology transfer to reduce dependency), but not focused on interoperability.
* **RQ2:** 1 – Explores conditions for durable collaboration (enforced technology transfer, SME certification, case studies of South Korea/Turkey/Singapore).
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Notes risks of bureaucratic overload when enforcing offsets.
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Highlights positive examples (South Korea, Turkey, Singapore).
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Explains negative outcomes (transactional licensed assembly due to absent offset clauses).

#### **Amara & Pargač (2009)** – *Czech Gripen industrial cooperation programme*

**Summary:** The authors describe the Czech Republic’s Industrial Cooperation Programme for the JAS‑39 Gripen. A multi‑ministry commission oversaw offsets, requiring at least 20 % direct industrial participation. Within two years, 26 % of obligations were delivered, but the programme also highlighted complexity and hidden agendas.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Shows that offsets can integrate SMEs into supply chains, potentially improving readiness.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Illustrates conditions (comprehensive agreement, multi‑ministry oversight) for lasting collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Warns of complexity and risks of hidden agendas.
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Provides a positive case of a small nation achieving industrial collaboration.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No major frictions or negative integration outcomes reported.

#### **Anicetti (2024)** – *EU arms collaboration and offsets after Ukraine invasion*

**Summary:** Offset demands have become more widespread and less transparent post‑2022, increasing fragmentation and dependence on non‑EU suppliers. The EU procurement directive formally restricts offsets, but member states frequently use exemptions. The Czech–Slovak CV90 case demonstrates how separate national offset demands fragmented a joint programme.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 1 – Shows offsets fragment multinational programmes and undermine interoperability (CV90 case).
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Notes that G2G agreements can create long‑term partnerships but also lock‑in dependence.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Highlights risks of transparency and market fragmentation.
* **RQ4:** 0 – Does not provide positive examples.
* **RQ5:** 1 – Provides a negative comparative case where offsets undermined regional collaboration.

#### **Anicetti (2025)** – *Persistence of offsets in supply‑driven arms markets*

**Summary:** Central and Eastern European countries paused offsets to prioritise rapid deliveries after Russia’s invasion, then resumed industrial participation via G2G deals. Initial batches are delivered turnkey; follow‑on deliveries involve domestic component production, licensed production and MRO. The study argues that self‑sufficiency, strategic G2G relationships and long time horizons sustain offset demands.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 1 – Demonstrates how phased offsets balance readiness with supply resilience (rapid deliveries vs later localisation).
* **RQ2:** 1 – Identifies conditions for durable collaboration—G2G frameworks, long timelines and self‑sufficiency.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Implicitly addresses risks (dependency) but not deeply.
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Presents positive cases (Poland, Romania) of combining offsets with allied integration.
* **RQ5:** 0 – Does not detail negative cases.

#### **Arafia (2020)** – *Indonesia’s trade return/local content/offset scheme*

**Summary:** Indonesia’s IDKLO mechanism requires at least 85 % trade return/local content/offset with a minimum 35 % local content. Direct offsets include technology transfer, training, co‑production and buybacks. An example SU‑35 barter deal illustrates difficulty matching commodities and negotiating countertrade, resulting in delays.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Focuses on barter complexity rather than alliance interoperability.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Discusses local content and technology transfer conditions.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Highlights risks of countertrade delays and unclear outcomes.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive comparative case.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Shows difficulties causing delays and potential frictions.

#### **Balakrishnan & Matthews (2009)** – *Offsets in Malaysian defence industrialisation*

**Summary:** Malaysia’s offsets produced some successes: SME Aerospace and CTRM evolved into global suppliers. However, offsets focus heavily on MRO (manufacturing only ~8 % of value) and local firms remain dependent on foreign technology; R&D is minimal and export controls/royalties hinder technology transfer.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Shows how offsets integrate firms into global supply chains (positive) but highlight limited high‑value manufacturing (negative).
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Identifies conditions for collaboration (long‑term relationships with prime contractors) and barriers (export controls).
* **RQ3:** 1 – Discusses risks: technology leakage fears, MRO focus, export‑control delays.
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Highlights positive cases of firms joining international supply chains.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Underscores mixed outcomes and limited local capability due to cost and export restrictions.

#### **Balakrishnan (2022)** – *Technology absorption capability challenges*

**Summary:** Interviews from Southeast Asian offsets reveal unrealistic government expectations (demanding high‑tech transfers despite limited capacity), lack of end‑user responsibility, inadequate programme management and quality control, miscommunication between buyers and suppliers, export‑control constraints and insufficient expertise among procurement officials.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Suggests that poor absorption capability undermines readiness and supply reliability.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Shows that clear responsibilities and strong management are prerequisites for durable collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Provides detailed risks (miscommunication, protectionist laws, lack of expertise) and implies need for governance.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive examples.
* **RQ5:** 1 – Presents negative cases where offset projects failed due to these issues.

#### **Berkok (2005)** – *Offset multipliers and absorption capacity*

**Summary:** Berkok analyses how transaction costs and matching markets deter prime contractors, and how high absorption capacity (industrial clusters and linkages) reduces offset costs and enables adaptation of transferred technology. It warns that high offset multipliers distort investment and channel resources into low‑absorption sectors.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Addresses supply chain integration and adaptation, but not directly about NATO operations.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Shows durable collaboration depends on industrial clusters and absorptive capacity.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Highlights risks of transaction costs and distortions from high multipliers.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No country cases.
* **RQ5:** 0 – Theoretical analysis, no negative case.

#### **Bezuidenhout (2022)** – *Technology transfer processes in defence offsets*

**Summary:** Through case-study interviews, the paper identifies factors for successful technology transfer: strong management commitment, financial resources, supply‑chain planning and transparent communication. Hidden political agendas and cultural differences hamper technology transfer; top management often lacks commitment.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Focused on project management rather than alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 1 – Provides detailed conditions for successful co‑development and training.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Flags risks (hidden agendas, misaligned motives) and suggests mitigations (transparency, early supply‑chain planning).
* **RQ4:** 0 – No comparative cases.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Shows negative effects of poor management but not at national scale.

#### **Herrara (2008)** – *Offsets in Latin America*

**Summary:** This survey highlights major offset programmes: Brazil’s Gripen deal promises 100 % technology transfer and 80 % local production with Swedish co‑operation; Colombia’s offsets cover an airworthiness department and a Black‑Hawk training centre. The article concludes that success depends on absorptive capacity; many Latin American states have low skills and small scales, hindering real benefits.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Provides examples where offsets may improve supply autonomy, but overall emphasises absorptive limitations.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Notes that direct offsets (e.g., Brazilian co‑production) can build local industry if capacity exists.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Touches on challenges (low skills, scale) but little on corruption or mitigation.
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Highlights Brazil as a positive but unproven case.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Points out the risk that offsets fail to deliver due to absorptive capacity constraints.

#### **Holden (2020)** – *Offsets in South Africa’s arms deal*

**Summary:** South Africa’s 1999 Arms Deal offsets were manipulated. Multipliers and “package deals” allowed contractors to claim credits far exceeding actual investment. One package gave $1.7 bn in credits for a $6.6 m investment. Offsets often failed; projects collapsed, offering little industrial benefit.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Does not address alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 0 – Focuses on mismanagement rather than collaboration conditions.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Highly relevant as a risk case: manipulation, misaligned incentives and failure highlight corruption and governance issues.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive cases.
* **RQ5:** 1 – Demonstrates negative outcomes (collapse of projects, credit inflation) and policy flaws.

#### **Ianakiev (2014)** – *Offsets in EU procurement*

**Summary:** Offsets are viewed as trade‑distorting, supporting inefficient domestic suppliers or opening supply chains for new entrants. The EU Defence Procurement Directive (2009/81/EC) requires member states to suppress mandatory offset policies; offsets are permitted only for essential security interests.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Addresses how offset restrictions influence European defence cooperation and standardisation.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Notes that offsets can help new suppliers enter supply chains but emphasises directive limiting them.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Discusses risks of trade distortion and the EU’s legal framework mitigating them.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive examples.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Illustrates how offsets might hinder integration and why EU limits them.

#### **Jang (2023)** – *Trends in South Korean defence offsets*

**Summary:** South Korea’s offset requirements originated in 1982 and evolved through threshold changes. From 2016–2020, offset returns dropped to one‑tenth of earlier levels due to debates about abolishing the legal requirement and absence of offset banking. The report recommends reinforcing offsets, adopting an offset banking scheme and implementing top‑down negotiation strategies.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Discusses how offsets support technology transfer and localisation, contributing to supply security, but not directly about NATO.
* **RQ2:** 1 – Provides conditions for durable collaboration: offset banking, extended execution windows and comprehensive negotiation.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Notes risks such as declining offset value and internal disagreements; suggests mitigation (offset banking and strategies).
* **RQ4:** 1 – Presents South Korea as a positive case of successful industrialisation via offsets (with caveats).
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative cases.

#### **Kanniaïnen (2017)** – *Theoretical model of offsets as insurance*

**Summary:** The paper models offset contracts as insurance: national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction, meaning that offsets enhance security, but the offset claim is capitalised in the delivery price. Thus offsets are not costless; the buyer pays higher prices.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Suggests offsets increase national security but at a cost; little on interoperability.
* **RQ2:** 0 – No discussion of durable collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Addresses cost impacts as a risk.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No comparative cases.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative case.

#### **Lazar (2019)** – *Comparative study of Gripen offsets in Hungary and Czech Republic*

**Summary:** Hungary’s offset programme (2001–2015) invested in already developed regions; only 0.6 % of resources reached priority areas and domestic defence firms were excluded. Some participating companies went bankrupt. The Czech programme, overseen by the MoD, spread resources more widely, involved SMEs and integrated domestic firms into Gripen supply chains. Lack of cooperation among Visegrad countries and absence of monitoring hindered success.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Demonstrates that targeted offsets can integrate SMEs and support supply chains.
* **RQ2:** 1 – Identifies conditions (government leadership, broad participation) for durable collaboration and contrasts with failure.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Highlights risks from poor monitoring and regional fragmentation.
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Czech Republic appears as a positive case.
* **RQ5:** 1 – Hungary exemplifies negative outcomes of poorly designed offsets.

#### **Maharani & Matthews (2023)** – *Offsets in Indonesia’s strategic industries*

**Summary:** Offsets promise technology transfer but are often anti‑competitive, welfare‑reducing and carry cost premiums; success depends on recipient absorptive capacity. Indonesia’s offsets in the 1970s–1990s were informal, emphasising licensed production and making local firms low‑value subcontractors; a formal policy and coordinating committee (KKIP) were introduced in 2012.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Focuses on national industrial policy rather than alliance readiness.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Emphasises absorptive capacity and formal governance for successful collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Highlights risks: anti‑competitive effects, cost premiums and failure to deliver long‑term benefits.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive comparative case.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Shows negative outcomes of informal offsets in Indonesia.

#### **Markowski & Hall (2014)** – *Mandated defence offsets: can they ever deliver?*

**Summary:** The paper argues that mandatory offset schemes are inefficient: benefits are difficult to evaluate because costs are incurred up‑front and benefits may never materialise. Offsets limit buyer flexibility and increase contractual incompleteness; secondary requirements are vague and suppliers pad prices or walk away, leaving the buyer disadvantaged.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Does not discuss alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 0 – Focuses on economic inefficiency, not collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Highly relevant to risks: highlights cost/schedule impacts and market distortion.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive cases.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Implicitly illustrates negative effects of mandatory offsets.

#### **Markowski (1998)** – *Switzerland – pragmatic approach to defence procurement*

**Summary:** Switzerland expects reciprocal trade equal to 100 % of contract value. Direct offsets involve participation in production; indirect offsets cover exports, licensing, R&D and training. Cost premia (~4 %) are justified by savings from local upgrades. Offsets are justified as necessary because defence markets are distorted and offsets maintain domestic know‑how and political support.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Addresses supply security and readiness by maintaining domestic capabilities.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Suggests conditions (competitive suppliers, controlled cost premia) for cooperation.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Briefly mentions cost premiums but not detailed risks.
* **RQ4:** 1 – Provides a positive comparative case where offsets coexist with high integration.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative case.

#### **Matthews (2020)** – *European offset regimes and EU procurement reforms*

**Summary:** European offset regimes in the 1990s–2000s were prescriptive and penal; they failed to generate high‑value investment or skilled jobs. The EU Procurement Directive 2009/81/EC restricted indirect offsets and limited direct offsets to essential security interests. This led to dismantling national offset frameworks and encouraged joint European programmes.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Discusses how eliminating offsets promotes standardisation and joint programmes.
* **RQ2:** 0 – Does not explore conditions for collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Highlights risks of high‑cost, low‑value offsets and the regulatory mitigation.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive cases; emphasises abolishment.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Negative assessment of pre‑reform regimes.

#### **Matthews (2020b)** – *UK industrial participation policy*

**Summary:** The UK’s Industrial Participation (IP) policy invites suppliers to propose industrial benefits equal to 100 % of offshore content. Proposals are evaluated competitively without multipliers, keeping costs low. British exporters face a “Hobson’s choice”: they must offer technology transfer offsets to win sales or lose business; refusing to supply offsets risks creating competitors.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Focuses on national industry, not alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Touches on conditions: competitive evaluation without multipliers fosters efficient industrial collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Mentions risk of creating competitors and price loading.
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Presents a balanced approach enabling exports with minimal distortion.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative case.

#### **Matthews (1991)** – *Offsets and exporters’ dilemma*

**Summary:** British defence firms face a “Hobson’s choice”: rejecting offsets means losing business, but agreeing may help create future competitors.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Not about alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 0 – No conditions for collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Highlights risk to exporters and potential loss of industrial edge.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive case.
* **RQ5:** 0 – Not about negative partnership.

#### **Matthews & De Vera (2019)** – *Singapore’s defence‑industrial ecosystem*

**Summary:** Singapore negotiates offsets privately, allowing flexible, rigorous bargaining. Its offset deal for Formidable‑class frigates enabled local construction of five warships and joint stealth‑technology research with French partners. The state’s central agency (DSTA) coordinates technology development and offsets.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Demonstrates supply autonomy and integration with foreign partners.
* **RQ2:** 1 – Shows conditions for durable collaboration: case‑by‑case negotiation, strong central agency and co‑development.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Not focused on risks; implies good governance mitigates issues.
* **RQ4:** 1 – A positive case: offsets coexist with high levels of allied collaboration.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative outcomes.

#### **McKinsey (2014)** – *Managing offset obligations*

**Summary:** The report argues that offset packages can help Western defence firms win contracts—e.g., Lockheed Martin’s F‑16 offsets secured the Polish sale; Boeing’s training programmes built relationships in Saudi Arabia. Mismanaged offsets pose legal and reputational risks; some countries penalise non‑compliance. Offset recipients like Italy’s Alenia Aermacchi and Brazil’s Embraer have used offsets to build capabilities and become competitors.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Suggests offsets enhance alliances by enabling market access and training.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Highlights that offsets can foster long‑term relationships.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Details risks (legal, reputational) and mitigation (monitoring, penalties).
* **RQ4:** 0.5 – Notes positive cases of firms climbing up the value chain.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Points to mismanagement causing risks but not specific to alliance breakdown.

#### **Peterson (2011)** – *Offsets and national interests*

**Summary:** Governments use offsets to save on procurement costs, retain foreign currency, acquire technology, build skills, create jobs and strengthen defence industries. However, offsets can harm the exporter’s industrial base: using foreign suppliers or licensing production reduces domestic work and may create competitors. The U.S. government views offsets as inefficient and leaves them to private companies.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Focuses on national economic interests rather than alliance integration.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Discusses how technology and job creation aims align with durable collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Highlights risks: loss of domestic capacity and creation of competitors.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive case.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative case.

#### **Power (2025)** – *Dissertation on defence offsets*

**Summary:** Power argues that offsets increase contract prices as suppliers adjust prices to cover offset investments and that economic gains are dubious. Institutional arrangements matter: economic ministries push for larger offset packages, whereas defence ministries focus on equipment and price. Survey experiments show that offsets increase public support for defence purchases (sociotropic effect).
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Does not address alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 0 – No focus on durable collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Notes cost impacts and the politics of offset demands.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive case.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative case.

#### **Santos et al. (2023)** – *Offsets in reindustrialising countries*

**Summary:** In competitive defence markets, offsets often lead to ineffectiveness, lack of transparency and corruption. Portugal’s offset programme failed due to inter‑ministerial discord and vague contracts. The study argues direct offsets suit developed countries, while indirect offsets are better for developing states, reflecting absorptive capacity.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – Not about alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Suggests matching offset type to industrial capacity fosters collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Emphasises risks (corruption, lack of coordination) and mitigation (better governance).
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive case.
* **RQ5:** 1 – The Portuguese case illustrates negative outcomes from poor offset design.

#### **Spindel (2024)** – *Offsets for political leverage*

**Summary:** Spindel argues states pursue offsets less for economic benefit and more for political leverage. Leaders believe offsets will create enduring ties and influence the arms network; however, only technologically advanced states benefit from direct offsets, while others that rely on indirect offsets remain peripheral and powerless.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Suggests political offsets do not improve interoperability; advanced states may gain influence but others remain peripheral.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Implies durable collaboration arises only when recipients have advanced manufacturing capabilities.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Highlights risk of offsets entrenching unequal relationships.
* **RQ4:** 0 – Does not provide positive cases.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Indicates mixed outcomes where offsets fail to deliver promised benefits for less developed states.

#### **Transparency International (2010)** – *Offsets and corruption*

**Summary:** TI reports that offsets receive little scrutiny; due diligence, monitoring and audits are rare. Arranging offsets adds cost and benefits are uncertain. The report recommends performance monitoring, transparency, dual pricing and due diligence.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0 – No focus on alliance outcomes.
* **RQ2:** 0 – No conditions for durable collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 1 – Highly relevant to corruption and governance risks; provides mitigation measures.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive case.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Illustrates general negative environment but not country‑specific.

#### **Ungaro (2013)** – *Trends in the defence offset market*

**Summary:** This conference paper reviews global offset trends. It notes that offset obligations are growing worldwide and that many recipient countries are shifting from indirect to direct offsets emphasising technology transfer and long‑term partnerships. It warns that accumulating offset obligations could erode European defence companies’ competitiveness and that awareness of offsets’ implications for the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base is lacking.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Suggests that widespread offsets can shift global supply chains and affect European readiness, though not NATO‑specific.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Notes a shift towards direct offsets and long‑term partnerships as a condition.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Warns of risks to competitiveness but no detailed mitigation.
* **RQ4:** 0 – Does not cite specific positive cases.
* **RQ5:** 0.5 – Raises concerns that offsets may harm European technological edge.

#### **Weiss & Blauberger (2016)** – *EU Commission challenges to national offsets*

**Summary:** The EU Commission used judicial strategies to challenge national offset schemes; member states gradually changed their rules and offset requirements have been phased out despite global trends.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Shows how removing offsets supports EU‑wide standardisation and cooperation.
* **RQ2:** 0 – No conditions for collaboration.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Addresses regulatory mitigation of offset risks.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive case.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative case.

#### **Weiss & Biermann (2019)** – *EU defence cooperation and offsets*

**Summary:** The chapter explains that EU member states initially defended offsets but eventually accepted reforms when major powers offered supply‑chain compensations; reducing or abolishing offsets is considered complementary to deepening cooperation and strengthening the EDTIB.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Discusses how eliminating offsets fosters integration and common supply chains.
* **RQ2:** 0 – Does not explore specific conditions.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Shows that offset reform can mitigate risks and improve cooperation.
* **RQ4:** 0 – No positive country example.
* **RQ5:** 0 – No negative case.

#### **Zanotti (2011)** – *Turkey’s offset requirements and U.S.–Turkey defence cooperation*

**Summary:** Turkey’s strategic plan requires at least a 50 % return in direct or indirect offsets on procurement agreements of at least USD 10 million and emphasises co‑production and export licences. These requirements have clashed with U.S. export laws and pushed Turkey to seek suppliers more flexible on technology transfer.
**Scores:**

* **RQ1:** 0.5 – Shows how strict offsets influence supplier choices and may affect alliance interoperability.
* **RQ2:** 0.5 – Conditions: high offset returns and co‑production requirements support self‑reliance but risk partner friction.
* **RQ3:** 0.5 – Highlights risks (export‑control friction) but not mitigation.
* **RQ4:** 0 – Not a positive case.
* **RQ5:** 1 – An example of offset demands causing tensions and potential shifts away from NATO suppliers.

### Articles with little or no offset relevance

Several uploaded PDFs contain little or no content related to offsets or alliance‑relevant industrial participation. For completeness, each is summarised and scored low:
