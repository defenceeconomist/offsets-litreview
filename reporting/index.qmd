# OFFSETS Literature Review

A realist evidence synthesis and comparative case mapping of defence offsets/industrial participation policies, with a focus on alliance-relevant outcomes (e.g., interoperability, readiness, security of supply) and the conditions under which offsets help or hinder strategic partnerships.

## Aims

- Explain how offset and industrial participation policies interact with NATO-aligned defence priorities.
- Identify mechanisms and conditions that lead to durable industrial collaboration with allies and partners.
- Surface recurring risks (e.g., cost inflation, governance/opacity, corruption, export-control friction) and mitigation approaches.
- Map comparative country cases that demonstrate positive, negative, or mixed outcomes under different offset regimes.

## Research Questions

1. Under what contexts do offsets/industrial participation mechanisms enable alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability, readiness, security of supply, partnership durability)?
2. Which mechanisms systematically hinder those outcomes, and through what governance or market conditions?
3. How do policy design choices (mandatory vs. voluntary, direct vs. indirect, transparency/enforcement) shape collaboration depth and risk profiles across cases?
4. How can each pathway be summarized with enabling/limiting conditions and alliance-relevant outcomes?
5. What recurrent pathways can be mapped across countries to explain positive, negative, or mixed outcomes?

## Method

- **Realist evidence synthesis (CMO):** Extracts Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations from sources, then clusters mechanism tags into a small set of pathways (themes) to explain what works, for whom, and under what conditions; thematic summaries link pathways to alliance-relevant outcomes and enabling or constraining contexts.
- **Comparative case mapping:** Uses a consistent rubric to compare countries and programmes on policy design, depth of collaboration, alliance integration markers, and documented risks.
- **Two-lane search strategy:** Parallel searches for (1) offsets/industrial participation literature and (2) alliance-relevant industrial cooperation/interoperability literature to avoid terminology gaps.
- **Evidence mix:** Academic literature plus targeted grey literature (government policy, audits, NATO/EU material, and governance analyses).

In practice, the realist synthesis proceeds by extracting discrete CMO statements from each source, tagging contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes, and then grouping mechanisms into a small number of thematic pathways. Those pathways are summarized against alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability, readiness, security of supply, partnership durability) and the contextual conditions that enable or constrain them. The mechanism map provides a traceable bridge from individual CMO records to thematic findings.

**CMO workflow (short):**
1. Extract CMO statements from sources and record context, mechanism, and outcome tags.
2. Cluster mechanism tags into pathway themes (mechanism map).
3. Summarize each pathway with enabling/limiting conditions and alliance-relevant outcomes.
4. Trace claims back to source CMO records for verification.

**Mechanism theme workflow (detailed):**
1. Extract CMO statements into a structured dataset.
2. Generate a topic model over mechanism statements to surface recurring mechanism signals.
3. Use the topic model summary to propose candidate proto-mechanism themes.
4. Create `snake_case` labels for mechanisms and themes.
5. Assign mechanism labels to themes (using the “same underlying process?” test).
6. Review assignments; split or merge themes and add new themes for unmapped mechanisms.

**How the research questions are answered (outputs):**
- **RQ1 (enabling contexts):** pathway briefs that link *typical contexts* to alliance-relevant outcomes; cross-case notes on when those contexts recur.
- **RQ2 (hindering mechanisms):** pathway failure modes plus governance/market conditions (e.g., opacity, politicised workshare, export-control constraints) and any mitigating conditions.
- **RQ3 (policy design choices):** case mapping against a common rubric (mandatory/voluntary; direct/indirect; transparency/enforcement) and comparison of collaboration depth, alliance markers, and risk profiles.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(plotly)

sim_path <- "data/mechanism_cosine_similarity.csv"

sim_df <- read_csv(sim_path, show_col_types = FALSE)
rownames(sim_df) <- sim_df$id
sim_mat <- as.matrix(sim_df[ , -1, drop = FALSE])

plot_ly(
  x = colnames(sim_mat),
  y = rownames(sim_mat),
  z = sim_mat,
  type = "heatmap",
  colorscale = "Viridis",
  zmin = 0,
  zmax = 1

  layout(
    xaxis = list(title = "Mechanism ID", showticklabels = FALSE),
    yaxis = list(title = "Mechanism ID", showticklabels = FALSE)
