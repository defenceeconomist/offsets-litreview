	abstract = {The establishment of the European Defence Fund (EDF) marks a significant shift in how EU Member States approach the integration of the defence industry as it aims to systematically promote inter-European defence-industrial cooperation across national defence sectors. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence of the actual dynamics regarding EDF implementation. While there are accounts of EU countries’ varying political positions on defence integration, including its industrial aspect, it remains unclear whether Member States’ actual participation in integration projects aligns with these positions. Are national motives consistent once effective defence-industrial integration is underway? The findings, based on Masson’s (2024) data on by-country distribution of EDF project financing (2021–2022), present a more nuanced picture of EU countries’ effective engagement with defence-industrial integration than anticipated by the political perspective. While there is a positive relationship between participation in the EDF and defence market size, strategic culture does not influence EU members’ involvement in the Fund. Furthermore, while liberal economic-industrial governance is negatively associated with national participation in EDF projects, a country’s institutional quality has a significant positive relationship with it. This article reveals more complex dynamics of EDF implementation than suggested by the political perspective on defence-industrial integration pre-EDF. © Ringailė Kuokštytė, 2024 © Military Academy of Lithuania, 2024.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a policy framework for using offset and industrial collaboration (IC) to develop human capability in the defence and security sector, focusing on Malaysia. It underscores the importance of integrating human capital development with traditional defence spending. Key challenges and success factors in executing offset policies for human capability enhancement are identified. The introduced 'MINERVA' framework includes elements such as a clear vision for human capital development, capability gap analysis, knowledge transfer incentives, credible partners, governance frameworks, stakeholder engagement, efficient project implementation, and assessing absorptive capacity. Through qualitative analysis of Malaysian case studies, the paper highlights optimising defence budgets for skills, education and training. The paper argues that the alignment of international defence procurement with offset policies focused on human capital development can enhance indigenous defence capabilities, military potential, job creation, regional clusters and exports. This alignment bolsters national security and resilience against challenges such as digitalisation and pandemics. © 2024 Science and Technology Research Institute for Defence (STRIDE).

	abstract = {The European Union’s competences in armament policy have increased and its policy instruments have shifted towards military capacity-building. Illustrative of this, the European Defence Fund (EDF) finances cooperative research and development programmes in defence. Given military capacity-building’s centrality for statehood, I investigate the EDF to analyse the extent to which it challenges national prerogatives. I argue that the EDF represents a change away from the European Union’s regulatory role, and yet, does not correspond to a ‘positive’ supranational security state. Instead, the EDF represents a hybrid military capacity-building instrument, combining national ownership and EU (co-)financing of defence capacities. This argument builds conceptually on the state-building scholarship’s distinction between the centralisation of military and financial resources and adapts it to the EU multilevel governance. Theoretically, I build on constructivist public policy and core state power scholarship and demonstrate that the EDF’s hybrid design is the result of policy frame competition. The Commission-driven ‘efficiency’ frame, pushing for supranational centralisation of financial and military resources, was effectively tamed by member-states, whose preferences regarding defence and fiscal policies (‘distribution of competences’ frame) excluded EU ownership of defence assets and limited its financing role. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, EU countries sometimes decide to cooperate in the development of defence-industrial projects, to maintain defence procurement on a national basis or to import extra-EU armaments. To investigate the simultaneous presence of cooperation and competition, focusing on how the process of differentiated integration shapes European defence-industrial governance, this paper assesses Italian participation in two major European armaments organizations (OCCAR and the European Defence Agency), as well in two new EU initiatives in this sector (PeSCo and the European Defence Fund). Specifically, this analysis focuses on national state-arms industry relations as a crucial explanatory variable in the formation of Italy's preferences towards defence-industrial cooperation. © 2019 European Review of International Studies.

Whereas major accounts of integration depict defence policy as a least likely case, our process-tracing analysis shows that the EU's recent challenge of defence offsets was a case of supranational self-empowerment. We theorize two consecutive strategies of judicial politics, which the Commission employed at different policy stages to overcome opposition from Member States and defence firms against domestic policy change: judicialized law-making and opportunistic enforcement. Both strategies depend on three scope conditions: expansive case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), its fit with policy priorities of the Commission and a credible threat of follow-up litigation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Defence offsets are elements of defence procurement deals additional to the primary content. Offsets are usually expected to yield technological or industrial benefits to the purchasing country (e.g. countertrade, technology transfers, or additional jobs) and military buyers often require suppliers to make offsets available "cost-free." The authors argued previously that such strategies achieve little of value to buyers that lack market power and are unnecessary otherwise, since purchasers with the market power to extract more value for money from foreign suppliers can do so anyway. This article also focuses on the supply side of offset deals. The USA is the world's largest defence offsets supplier but the US government opposes offsets demands as economically inefficient and trade distorting. Even if offsets are inefficient and trade distorting, they may still benefit a materiel-exporting country such as the USA as they may induce exports and create associated benefits for the offsets provider. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Congress and the Obama Administration are seeking to manage longstanding bilateral and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-based defense cooperation with Turkey at a time when a more independent Turkish foreign policy course and changes in regional security conditions are creating new challenges for both countries. Defense cooperation rooted in shared threat perceptions from the Cold War era and built on close U.S. ties with the Turkish military leadership now must be reconciled with a decline of the military's political influence in Turkish society and some negative turns in Turkish popular sentiment toward the United States over the past decade. At the same time, Turkey's importance as a U.S. ally has arguably increased on issues of global significance in its surrounding region that include Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In early 2011, Turkey's regional role has arguably become even more prominent-exemplified by its significant involvement politically and militarily on the question of NATO's intervention in Libya. How Congress and the Administration manage defense cooperation with Turkey in this evolving context is likely to have a significant bearing on U.S. national security interests, as well as on both U.S. and Turkish calculations of the mutual benefits and leverage involved in the coo-perative relationship. Some officials and analysts believe that, in at least some respects, the United States needs Turkey more than Turkey needs the United States. Others counter that claims of Turkish leverage over the United States are exaggerated. Possible general congressional and Administration approaches to U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation ("Possible U.S. Policy Approaches") include • avoiding major recharacterizations of the alliance, while emphasizing and expressing confidence that existing NATO and bilateral relationships-with their long legacies-can address mutual security challenges; • according high priority to the alliance and revising expectations for it by accommodating new developments within and outside of Turkey; • linking cooperation in some way to Turkey's relations with certain third-party countries or non-state actors-including Iran, Israel, Hamas, Armenia, and China-or to Turkish actions on issues of U.S. national security interest; and • using or combining any of these approaches on a case-by-case basis. Specific issues that remain of significant importance for Congress (see "Specific Issues and Possible Options for Congress"), given its au-thority to appropriate funds, review major arms sales, consider non-binding resolutions, and provide general oversight include the following: • Continued military access to Turkish bases and transport corridors: The ongoing availability to the United States and NATO of Turkish bases and transport corridors-which have been used heavily for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya-is valuable and remains a possible point of contention and leverage. The extent of its importance and of alternatives may be subject to further analysis. • Future of Turkey-Israel relations: U.S. efforts to maintain alliances with both Turkey and Israel could be made more complicated if relations between them do not improve-potentially influencing the regional security environment. • Missile defense radar: Whether Turkey agrees in 2011 to host a U.S. forward-deployed radar for missile defense as part of the NATO system may depend on its perceptions of whether doing so would be more likely to cultivate stability or to be unduly provocative to neighboring countries. • Arms sales and industrial cooperation: Turkey continues to seek advanced military equipment from U.S. sources, particularly with respect to fighter and drone aircraft, helicopters, and missile defense systems (see "Arms Sales and Industrial Coo-peration"). At the same time, Turkey is increasingly diversifying its defense contacts and procurement relationships with non-NATO countries. • Military and security assistance: Although the United States no longer provides major annual grant aid to Turkey's military, assistance continues to foster cooperation on counterterrorism, law enforcement, and military training and education. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Overlooked in most scholarly analyses of European defense-industrial cooperation, the story of Europe's international armaments organizations stretches back more than six decades. In this article, we examine the impact of past institutional outcomes on the defense-industrial field by applying the concepts and analytic tools of historic institutionalism to European armaments organizations. Because past institutional dynamics have channeled the subsequent development of armaments cooperation, what has emerged is a polycentric governance architecture wherein organizations with transatlantic, pan-European and restrictive-European memberships dominate distinct components of the cooperative process. We demonstrate that this maturing institutional pattern will likely limit the opportunities for the EU–and especially its Commission–to shape the future contours of European defense-industrial cooperation. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This chapter reviews official offset audits conducted in 1995 (Sweden) and 1999 (Finland) and applies its own criteria of what an offset audit should cover. The official audits point to numerous difficulties involved in the administration, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of offsets, and the achievement of offset policy goals. Direct military offsets to support defense policy goals are relatively easy to specify, fulfill, implement, monitor, and evaluate. Their main limitation is their short contract duration. The use of indirect military offsets to support defense policy goals is more difficult to specify and implement but could, in principle, be designed toward long-term objectives. Indirect civil offsets are also difficult to specify and implement and are very difficult to monitor and evaluate. It may be more expedient to design a number of well defined indirect offset projects than to demand a high offset share. © 2004 Editorial matter, selection, and introduction Jurgen Brauer & J.Paul Dunne; individual chapters, the contributors.

They also stated that both required and accepted offsets will not exceed the value of the procurement contract and that the member states will use wherever predictable and on a voluntary basis. The latest move by the EDA is seen as a compromise between the two opposing views that "offsets are an advantage" and "offset should be phased our eventually".
