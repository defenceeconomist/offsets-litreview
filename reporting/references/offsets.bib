  abstract = {This study examines how Indonesia can advance its Defense Industrialization 5.0 goals by adopting an Enforced Autonomy Model---an approach that treats industrial development not as a market-driven evolution but as a statemandated mission. Through qualitative policy analysis and diagnostic tools like the Ishikawa diagram and Arms Production Ladder, the paper identifies persistent challenges that hinder progress, including fragmented governance, outdated technology, limited R\&D investment, and weak integration of local suppliers. These challenges, while well-known, are often addressed through voluntary policies that lack binding force. The Enforced Autonomy Model proposed in this study introduces a shift in perspective: it argues that without enforcement mechanisms---such as presidential-level authority, mandatory local content rules, and structured talent pipelines---Indonesia will remain dependent on foreign suppliers and struggle to meet long-term strategic goals. Drawing lessons from countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Singapore, the paper demonstrates that meaningful transformation in the defense sector requires strong political leadership, clear targets, and institutional accountability. To operationalize this approach, the study outlines six strategic roadmaps covering human capital, production line modernization, supply chain development, product innovation, export promotion, and governance reform. Each roadmap includes enforceable targets tied to legal or regulatory instruments, ensuring alignment across ministries, state-owned enterprises, and research institutions. The findings suggest that by embedding enforcement into national policy, Indonesia can not only achieve the targets set in its 2045 development agenda but also emerge as a key defense supplier for the Global South. In doing so, the country would shift from being a passive participant in global defense markets to a proactive industrial actor capable of innovation, autonomy, and strategic relevance.},

  abstract = {In the last twenty years, the EU has made increasingly greater efforts to boost defence cooperation among MS. To strengthen the EDTIB and avoid duplication of capabilities, the EU has encouraged ``European preference'' in arms procurement and MS' defence collaborative projects, also by seeking to expunge defence offsets from the single market. Against this backdrop, on 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. What impact has the war in Ukraine had on EU defence cooperation? Has the war impacted MS in a similar fashion or unevenly, reinforcing defence integration dynamics for some, while kickstarting disintegration for others? Two years on, a thorough analysis of the impact of the war on EU defence cooperation is still missing. This paper fills this gap by exploring three levels of analysis -- arms collaboration, arms procurement, and offsets -- and by comparing pre-invasion evidence with data from the post-invasion period. The analysis suggests that the Russo-Ukrainian war has negatively impacted EU defence cooperation, potentially increasing both fragmentation and non-EU dependencies. However, although MS' threat perception and their ability to reap industrial benefits remain important to explain EU defence cooperation, integration or disintegration dynamics do not neatly map onto the geographical or size divides identified by the literature.},

  abstract = {Historically, defense offsets have been viewed as a feature of buyer-driven markets, where surplus supply of weapons gives buyer states the leverage to demand additional industrial and technological benefits from foreign suppliers. However, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the global arms trade has shifted to a supply-driven market, where demand outstrips supply. Despite this shift, countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have continued to prioritize offsets, even though their bargaining power has diminished. This paper seeks to explain this apparent paradox through an inductive research design and qualitative methods, ultimately proposing a new theoretical framework based on three key factors: the growing drive for self-sufficiency, the strategic importance of government-to-government relationships, and the long-term planning horizons associated with defense procurement in the region. By analyzing recent offset agreements in CEE, it demonstrates how these factors collectively sustain offset demands -- even in a supply-constrained market -- while also providing insights into broader dynamics in global defense trade as well as arms collaboration.},

The research approach used is a qualitative approach. This type of research is a systematic review research. Likewise, the defense industry of a country reflects the economic strength of its country, because in carrying out the defense function, the defense industry has a very important role, including in holding the national Main Tool of the Armament System. However, now not all defense equipment can be produced by the domestic defense industry, so some defense equipment must still be held in cooperation with foreign countries. Law No. 16 of 2012 concerning the Defense Industry mandates that procurement of defense equipment from abroad be permitted if it fulfills several requirements, including trade returns, local content, and offset. Counter trade is one of the mechanisms of cooperation that has been carried out by Indonesia. This mechanism allows reciprocal trade between two countries by buying goods from abroad with payment in the form of goods worth the goods imported. So it is important to analyze the potential for economic improvement for Indonesia that is generated by the mechanism of trade defense equipment from abroad, so that in conducting cooperation, Indonesia can benefit both in the short and long term.},

In 2019 it was estimated to form at least 40\%, or \$123 billion USD, of total international defence trade. Whilst purchasing nations set requirements for TOT within their industrial participation (IP) policies, there is often a mismatch between the scale and type of technology suppliers can offer and the buyer's technological absorption capability (TAC). This persistent tension between ambition and reality frequently strains the buyer-supplier relationship. Thus, understanding how TAC can be enhanced is of vital importance. This paper defines TAC in the international defence acquisition and offsets context and determines the factors for successful TAC. The paper focusses on the potential challenges for successful TAC and offers recommendations on how to enhance TAC. This research is limited to the context of Southeast Asia.

  abstract = {Mandatory offsets are policy instruments to leverage defence procurement projects to conduct industrial policy. The prime contractor commits to generate new business in mutually acceptable sectors equivalent to a large percentage of the project value. Offset multipliers ``relax'' this constraint by discounting the prime contractor's offset obligations if investments flow to sectors prioritized by the purchasing country's industrial policy objectives. This endogenizes the relationship between the original project and the offset contracts. This paper provides a new theoretical analysis of the following three questions that have gone unaddressed in the literature. First, the efficiency of such policies depends on the absorption capacity of a targeted industry. If this capacity is low, import substitution is expensive and the prime contractor may rather choose to invest elsewhere in the economy to satisfy the overall mandatory offset constraint thereby thwarting the original objective. Second, whereas a uniform relaxation of offsets through multipliers can reduce distortions introduced by mandated offsets, multipliers may enhance distortions as an unintended consequence. Third, the prime contractor's response to offset credit incentives may be weak due to transaction costs arising from having to find new domestic partners to satisfy the offset requirements and manage the contracts.},

Among all the initiatives conducted, the European Defense Fund (EDF) and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PeSCo) in defense can be easily considered as proof of a revived interest in defense-industrial cooperation. Given this European activism, it is not surprising that the academic literature has focused on the main actors and the main strategic and economic drivers that have spurred European defense-industrial cooperation. However, the scholarly literature on the topic has erroneously over-emphasized the cooperative elements, while underestimating the peculiarities of a policy-field which remains characterized by both cooperative and competitive dynamics. Indeed, notwithstanding the presence of stable alliances, common regulations in defense procurement and a number of transnational business groups, the European defense-industrial field remains also fragmented in terms of both supply and demand. The article has two goals: first, it proposes a Liberal-Intergovernmentalist research agenda to explain the complex mix of cooperation and competition in this policyfield. Second, it aims to reflect on methodological issues in studying European armaments policies. Overall, the article wants to stimulate a constructive discussion, both from a theoretical and a methodological point of view, on a peculiar policy area that acts as an interface of industrial, technological and defense policies and lies at the intersection of International Relations (IR) traditional distinction between low and high politics.},

  abstract = {The European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) are both institutions through which European states can engage in European defence--industrial cooperation. Each organisation embodies a unique set of institutional tools through which to manage issues such as the high and rising costs of defence procurement, technological innovation, defence R\&D, standardisation, multinational capability programmes and interoperability. In short, the EU and NATO are institutional tools through which European states can manage the positive effects and negative consequences of defence globalisation. By drawing on an innovative conceptual framework derived from the institutional interaction literature, this article analyses how the EU and NATO interact with one another for defence--industrial issues. In doing so, the article principally aims to provide a conceptually informed analysis of the appeal of each body as a mechanism for defence--industrial cooperation and how each institution affects the other.},

Illustrative of this, the European Defence Fund (EDF) finances cooperative research and development programmes in defence. Given military capacity-building's centrality for statehood, I investigate the EDF to analyse the extent to which it challenges national prerogatives. I argue that the EDF represents a change away from the European Union's regulatory role, and yet, does not correspond to a `positive' supranational security state. Instead, the EDF represents a hybrid military capacity-building instrument, combining national ownership and EU (co-)financing of defence capacities. This argument builds conceptually on the state-building scholarship's distinction between the centralisation of military and financial resources and adapts it to the EU multilevel governance. Theoretically, I build on constructivist public policy and core state power scholarship and demonstrate that the EDF's hybrid design is the result of policy frame competition. The Commission-driven `efficiency' frame, pushing for supranational centralisation of financial and military resources, was effectively tamed by member-states, whose preferences regarding defence and fiscal policies (`distribution of competences' frame) excluded EU ownership of defence assets and limited its financing role.},

However, there is extremely limited data regarding the economic efficacy or rationality of offsets. Recent disclosures related to South Africa's controversial 1999 ``Arms Deal'' about the economic performance of its sizeable offset obligations provides solid evidence that the manipulation of offset scoring systems allowed defense manufacturers to invest far less than originally contracted. The South African experience indicates that there are likely to be structural features inherent in all civilian offsets flowing from defense contracts that exert a downward pressure on the actual economic investments delivered by defense manufacturers.},

This article thus examines whether international economic law expedites or obstructs Asia's energy transition, and whether LCRs are incompatible with international economic law. To answer these questions, this article juxtaposes LCR provisions in JETPs and domestic regulations in two case studies: Indonesia and Vietnam. It then contextualizes LCR costs and benefits before examining tensions with international economic law and potential state defences justifying LCRs. It culminates in suggesting how LCRs could be designed to neutralize such tensions. This article argues that international economic law complements, rather than collides with, energy transition goals and that LCRs are not anathema to international economic law, as long as they are designed and implemented in a nondiscriminatory manner.},

The rising costs of defence equipment and the significant contraction of defence spending have resulted in an environment that favoured the use of offset policies, the latter becoming increasingly demanding in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The chapter analyses the role of offsets on the process of integration of defence equipment markets, with a specific focus on the EU. Particular attention is given to the offset-relevant regulation and practice and to their recent evolution in the EU following the adoption of European Directive on defence and security procurement (81/81/EC). Offsets play a dual role with regard to the integration of defence industries: on one hand they can be trade-distorting and contribute to the survival of inefficient suppliers in arms importing countries; on the other hand, they can contribute in overcoming barriers that may otherwise prevent some potentially efficient suppliers from accessing the supply chains of the big system integrators. The chapter draws the attention on the need to complement the regulatory evolution by further initiatives aiming at improving the access of non-incumbent suppliers to the supply chains of the large defence system integrators.},

A new rationale is suggested for offsets in terms of their role as an insurance devise. Results are derived for the pricing of delivery contracts subject to offset claims and their national security implications. It is shown that the national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction. As to the incidence of the offset, the offset claim is shown to be capitalised in the delivery price. The bargaining price is shown to depend on the value of the product to be delivered for the national security, the relative negotiation power of the contracting partners and the social cost of public funds. The analysis highlights the expectation effects of offsets on the bargaining price and the scale of delivery. The results aid in explaining why offsets are widely used in procurement contracts for defence materiel. As they contribute to the national security, they should be allowed to survive and not be denied under competition laws.},

Recognising its strategic importance, the Commission published the first-ever European Defence Industrial Strategy that seeks to increase intra-EU defence industrial cooperation and promote collaborative defence equipment development and procurement. The paper sets out to examine the degree of connectedness among major European defence industries applying a quantile connectedness approach to examine the degree and direction of connectedness among 15 major European defence companies. The estimations span the period from January 2018 to February 2024, which allows for a total of 1453 daily stock price observations per company. Results reported herein suggest the presence of a strong total connectedness among these major European defence industries. The findings reveal three broad groupings with respect to net total directional connectedness: a net-transmitting group, a netreceiving group of defence industries and finally a group that exhibits mixed connectedness.},

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence of the actual dynamics regarding EDF implementation. While there are accounts of EU countries' varying political positions on defence integration, including its industrial aspect, it remains unclear whether Member States' actual participation in integration projects aligns with these positions. Are national motives consistent once effective defenceindustrial integration is underway? The findings, based on Masson's (2024) data on by-country distribution of EDF project financing (2021--2022), present a more nuanced picture of EU countries' effective engagement with defence-industrial integration than anticipated by the political perspective. While there is a positive relationship between participation in the EDF and defence market size, strategic culture does not influence EU members' involvement in the Fund. Furthermore, while liberal economicindustrial governance is negatively associated with national participation in EDF projects, a country's institutional quality has a significant positive relationship with it. This article reveals more complex dynamics of EDF implementation than suggested by the political perspective on defence-industrial integration pre-EDF.},

  abstract = {Defense and commercial trade offsets (also known as countertrade or industrial participation) are valued in the tens of billions of dollars each year and often accompany the export of advanced technological goods. An offset is any type of non-monetary compensation that a procuring government requires an exporting firm to provide as a condition of the sale and generally commits the exporting firm to spend a certain percentage of the value of the sale in the procuring country. This paper examines 1) how procuring governments use offsets to achieve their goals, and 2) the economic and national security implications of offsets.},

  abstract = {Why do states agree to offset provisions when they purchase weapons, and what are the consequences of different types of offsets? This article takes a network approach to understanding the causes and consequences of offsets in the arms trade. It argues that offset clauses create network ties that affect a state's position and power in the global arms production network. This depends on the type of offset it pursues---only a small subset of states with advanced technological manufacturing capabilities can maintain a central and powerful position by leveraging direct offsets. Other states must pursue indirect offsets, which have the opposite effect and keep these states locked into peripheral positions of limited power. Through case studies of offset use in India and Malaysia, this article shows how difficult it is to achieve network interdependence (India), and the difficulties of using indirect offsets to achieve political goals (Malaysia).},

  abstract = {This chapter examines to what extent Europe's governments and defence contractors cooperate to provide European Armed Forces with military capabilities. Defence industrial cooperation has evolved as almost the default policy option for European powers to develop large military platforms. Yet, there is no uniform trend, but large variation across countries (for example, France versus Germany), across sectors (land versus air versus sea), and with regards to the sources of cooperation (for example, government induced versus investment driven). The chapter shows that, while the major powers dominate defence industrial cooperation both at the government and at the corporate level, the lesser powers and smaller defence firms follow the trend and participate in the supply chains of large weaponry. Finally, the chapter addresses the question whether cooperation or competition represents the most promising strategy towards a capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base.},

  abstract = {This article seeks to explain how the European Union (EU) -- by challenging national defence offsets -- managed to move into a highly sensitive policy area under formerly exclusive Member State competence. Whereas major accounts of integration depict defence policy as a least likely case, our process-tracing analysis shows that the EU's recent challenge of defence offsets was a case of supranational self-empowerment. We theorize two consecutive strategies of judicial politics, which the Commission employed at different policy stages to overcome opposition from Member States and defence firms against domestic policy change: judicialized law-making and opportunistic enforcement. Both strategies depend on three scope conditions: expansive case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), its fit with policy priorities of the Commission and a credible threat of follow-up litigation.},

  author = {Zanotti, Jim},
  abstract = {Congress and the Obama Administration are seeking to manage longstanding bilateral and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-based defense cooperation with Turkey at a time when a more independent Turkish foreign policy course and changes in regional security conditions are creating new challenges for both countries. Defense cooperation rooted in shared threat perceptions from the Cold War era and built on close U.S. ties with the Turkish military leadership now must be reconciled with a decline of the military's political influence in Turkish society and some negative turns in Turkish popular sentiment toward the United States over the past decade. At the same time, Turkey's importance as a U.S. ally has arguably increased on issues of global significance in its surrounding region that include Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In early 2011, Turkey's regional role has arguably become even more prominent---exemplified by its significant involvement politically and militarily on the question of NATO's intervention in Libya.},
