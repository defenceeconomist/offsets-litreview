            The use of offsets is one of the main characteristics of international defence trade. The rising costs of defence equipment and the significant contraction of defence spending have resulted in an environment that favoured the use of offset policies, the latter becoming increasingly demanding in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The chapter analyses the role of offsets on the process of integration of defence equipment markets, with a specific focus on the EU. Particular attention is given to the offset-relevant regulation and practice and to their recent evolution in the EU following the adoption of European Directive on defence and security procurement (81/81/EC). Offsets play a dual role with regard to the integration of defence industries: on one hand they can be trade-distorting and contribute to the survival of inefficient suppliers in arms importing countries; on the other hand, they can contribute in overcoming barriers that may otherwise prevent some potentially efficient suppliers from accessing the supply chains of the big system integrators. The chapter draws the attention on the need to complement the regulatory evolution by further initiatives aiming at improving the access of non-incumbent suppliers to the supply chains of the large defence system integrators.},

Part I examines the external dimension of a new EU Defence Procurement Directive, focusing on its implications for third countries, in particular the US. Part II examines foreign access and treatment under US law. Part III maps a future research agenda that is essential for a more systematic understanding of legal barriers to transatlantic defence trade.

Whereas major accounts of integration depict defence policy as a least likely case, our process-tracing analysis shows that the EU’s recent challenge of defence offsets was a case of supranational self-empowerment. We theorize two consecutive strategies of judicial politics, which the Commission employed at different policy stages to overcome opposition from Member States and defence ﬁrms against domestic policy change: judicialized law-making and opportunistic enforcement. Both strategies depend on three scope conditions: expansive case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), its ﬁt with policy priorities of the Commission and a credible threat of follow-up litigation.},

This article takes a network approach to understanding the causes and consequences of offsets in the arms trade. It argues that offset clauses create network ties that affect a state’s position and power in the global arms production network. This depends on the type of offset it pursues—only a small subset of states with advanced technological manufacturing capabilities can maintain a central and powerful position by leveraging direct offsets. Other states must pursue indirect offsets, which have the opposite effect and keep these states locked into peripheral positions of limited power. Through case studies of offset use in India and Malaysia, this article shows how difficult it is to achieve network interdependence (India), and the difficulties of using indirect offsets to achieve political goals (Malaysia).},

The prime contractor commits to generate new business in mutually acceptable sectors equivalent to a large percentage of the project value. Offset multipliers “relax” this constraint by discounting the prime contractor’s offset obligations if investments flow to sectors prioritized by the purchasing country’s industrial policy objectives. This endogenizes the relationship between the original project and the offset contracts. This paper provides a new theoretical analysis of the following three questions that have gone unaddressed in the literature. First, the efficiency of such policies depends on the absorption capacity of a targeted industry. If this capacity is low, import substitution is expensive and the prime contractor may rather choose to invest elsewhere in the economy to satisfy the overall mandatory offset constraint thereby thwarting the original objective. Second, whereas a uniform relaxation of offsets through multipliers can reduce distortions introduced by mandated offsets, multipliers may enhance distortions as an unintended consequence. Third, the prime contractor’s response to offset credit incentives may be weak due to transaction costs arising from having to find new domestic partners to satisfy the offset requirements and manage the contracts.},

A new rationale is suggested for offsets in terms of their role as an insurance devise. Results are derived for the pricing of delivery contracts subject to offset claims and their national security implications. It is shown that the national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction. As to the incidence of the offset, the offset claim is shown to be capitalised in the delivery price. The bargaining price is shown to depend on the value of the product to be delivered for the national security, the relative negotiation power of the contracting partners and the social cost of public funds. The analysis highlights the expectation effects of offsets on the bargaining price and the scale of delivery. The results aid in explaining why offsets are widely used in procurement contracts for defence materiel. As they contribute to the national security, they should be allowed to survive and not be denied under competition laws.},

	abstract = {Historically, defense offsets have been viewed as a feature of buyer-driven markets, where surplus supply of weapons gives buyer states the leverage to demand additional industrial and technological benefits from foreign suppliers. However, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the global arms trade has shifted to a supply-driven market, where demand outstrips supply. Despite this shift, countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have continued to prioritize offsets, even though their bargaining power has diminished. This paper seeks to explain this apparent paradox through an inductive research design and qualitative methods, ultimately proposing a new theoretical framework based on three key factors: the growing drive for self-sufficiency, the strategic importance of government-to-government relationships, and the long-term planning horizons associated with defense procurement in the region. By analyzing recent offset agreements in CEE, it demonstrates how these factors collectively sustain offset demands – even in a supply-constrained market – while also providing insights into broader dynamics in global defense trade as well as arms collaboration.},

 abstract = {This essay provides a comprehensive synthesis of the Polish military's fighter aircraft selection process, assesses the dominant issues, and answers the question, "Why did Poland choose the F-16?" It begins with a brief examination of Poland's military aircraft status and military aircraft industrial production capability from approximately 1990 to 2002, its requirements for an advanced fighter aircraft, and Poland's military hardware procurement and acquisition processes. Analysis then turns to acquisition reforms associated with the F-16 decision, the institutional structure for purchasing military aircraft, the mechanics of the F-16 decision, and who ultimately made the decision. Given the centrality to the decision process, a capabilities comparison of the three competitors—the Lockheed Martin F-16, Saab/BAE Systems JAS-39 Gripen, and the Dassault Mirage 2000-5 Mk II—is offered and interoperability considerations addressed. This study then outlines the financial construction of the three bids, to include economic issues and pressures from the U.S., French, and Swedish governments and industry, and an in-depth analysis of industrial offsets. Lastly, it will examine political issues associated with the F-16 purchase.},
