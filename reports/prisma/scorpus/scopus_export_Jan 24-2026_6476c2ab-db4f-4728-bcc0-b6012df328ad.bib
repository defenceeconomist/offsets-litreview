	abstract = {This study examines how Indonesia can advance its Defense Industrialization 5.0 goals by adopting an Enforced Autonomy Model-an approach that treats industrial development not as a market-driven evolution but as a statemandated mission. Through qualitative policy analysis and diagnostic tools like the Ishikawa diagram and Arms Production Ladder, the paper identifies persistent challenges that hinder progress, including fragmented governance, outdated technology, limited R&D investment, and weak integration of local suppliers. These challenges, while well-known, are often addressed through voluntary policies that lack binding force. The Enforced Autonomy Model proposed in this study introduces a shift in perspective: it argues that without enforcement mechanisms-such as presidential-level authority, mandatory local content rules, and structured talent pipelines-Indonesia will remain dependent on foreign suppliers and struggle to meet long-term strategic goals. Drawing lessons from countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Singapore, the paper demonstrates that meaningful transformation in the defense sector requires strong political leadership, clear targets, and institutional accountability. To operationalize this approach, the study outlines six strategic roadmaps covering human capital, production line modernization, supply chain development, product innovation, export promotion, and governance reform. Each roadmap includes enforceable targets tied to legal or regulatory instruments, ensuring alignment across ministries, state-owned enterprises, and research institutions. The findings suggest that by embedding enforcement into national policy, Indonesia can not only achieve the targets set in its 2045 development agenda but also emerge as a key defense supplier for the Global South. In doing so, the country would shift from being a passive participant in global defense markets to a proactive industrial actor capable of innovation, autonomy, and strategic relevance. © (c) 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {Compared with high-income countries (HICs), developing € Chat-IRB' - application-specific large language models for research ethics review - may have different implications for resource-constrained Research Ethics Committees or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While certain concerns raised by Moodley, Malpani, and Reis - including resource challenges, reviewing research conducted in LMICs, and automation bias - are not entirely unique to LMIC IRBs, the hurdles they must overcome in developing a contextualised Chat-IRB will likely be greater. Crucially, Chat-IRB for LMICs presents a significant opportunity to strengthen ethics capacity and bolster oversight through: (1) stimulating greater investment in generating open-access, LMIC-centred research ethics scholarship that also serves as training data; (2) leveraging existing WHO or UNESCO programmes to develop an € always available' training resource and review tool should international funding for ethics education and capacity-building be reduced or withdrawn; (3) mitigating inadequate human capacities by providing a € minimal acceptable standard' of review, especially during time-sensitive matters; and (4) a national-level Chat-IRB as a centralised € governance' mechanism and first-line defence against ethics dumping, IRB shopping, and other exploitative research practices. Taken holistically, purpose-built for LMICs, Chat-IRB represents a critical - but potentially unrecognised - opportunity for HICs to advance ethics capacity-building, and strengthen research oversight within LMICs. © 2026 BMJ Publishing Group.

	abstract = {Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) encourage coal-dependent emerging economies to phase out coal and transition to renewable energy. However, JETPs face significant obstacles, creating tensions with international economic law. Local content requirements (LCRs) represent a particularly problematic regulatory barrier to energy transitions. This article thus examines whether international economic law expedites or obstructs Asia's energy transition, and whether LCRs are incompatible with international economic law. To answer these questions, this article juxtaposes LCR provisions in JETPs and domestic regulations in two case studies: Indonesia and Vietnam. It then contextualizes LCR costs and benefits before examining tensions with international economic law and potential state defences justifying LCRs. It culminates in suggesting how LCRs could be designed to neutralize such tensions. This article argues that international economic law complements, rather than collides with, energy transition goals and that LCRs are not anathema to international economic law, as long as they are designed and implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Since the beginning of World War II, Canada and the United States have engaged in intensive defense industrial cooperation that has resulted in the integration of their defense industries. The official term used for explaining this phenomenon is a North American defense industrial base. The driving force behind this integration were the top U.S. defense companies, which opened their numerous branches and subsidiaries in Canada, and took command positions in the Canadian defense industry. The U.S.-Canadian defense industrial relationship has been incrementally institutionalized in several framework agreements. In 1956 and 1963, the United States and Canada entered into the Defense Production Sharing Agreement, and the Defense Development Sharing Agreement. Additionally, in 1993, the United States has designated Canada as part of the U.S. defense industrial base. Canada is unique among U.S. allies in that it is both a leading purchaser of major U.S. weapon systems and a key supplier of subsystems, components, and materials to the U.S. defense industry. Because of the high level of integration between the two economies at the sub-tier level, as well as the flow of goods between parent companies and subsidiaries, there is a much higher level of cross-border trade in parts and components between the U.S. and Canadian defense firms than the official SIPRI defense-trade statistics suggest. This article surveys the peculiarities of the Canadian defense industry, its contribution to the North American defense industrial base, the history of Canada-U.S. defense industrial cooperation, the division of labor in North America in the field of arms production, Canadian industrial capabilities, as well as the volume and dynamics of arms trade between two countries. © 2025.},

	abstract = {Historically, defense offsets have been viewed as a feature of buyer-driven markets, where surplus supply of weapons gives buyer states the leverage to demand additional industrial and technological benefits from foreign suppliers. However, in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the global arms trade has shifted to a supply-driven market, where demand outstrips supply. Despite this shift, countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have continued to prioritize offsets, even though their bargaining power has diminished. This paper seeks to explain this apparent paradox through an inductive research design and qualitative methods, ultimately proposing a new theoretical framework based on three key factors: the growing drive for self-sufficiency, the strategic importance of government-to-government relationships, and the long-term planning horizons associated with defense procurement in the region. By analyzing recent offset agreements in CEE, it demonstrates how these factors collectively sustain offset demands–even in a supply-constrained market–while also providing insights into broader dynamics in global defense trade as well as arms collaboration. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The establishment of the European Defence Fund (EDF) marks a significant shift in how EU Member States approach the integration of the defence industry as it aims to systematically promote inter-European defence-industrial cooperation across national defence sectors. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence of the actual dynamics regarding EDF implementation. While there are accounts of EU countries’ varying political positions on defence integration, including its industrial aspect, it remains unclear whether Member States’ actual participation in integration projects aligns with these positions. Are national motives consistent once effective defence-industrial integration is underway? The findings, based on Masson’s (2024) data on by-country distribution of EDF project financing (2021–2022), present a more nuanced picture of EU countries’ effective engagement with defence-industrial integration than anticipated by the political perspective. While there is a positive relationship between participation in the EDF and defence market size, strategic culture does not influence EU members’ involvement in the Fund. Furthermore, while liberal economic-industrial governance is negatively associated with national participation in EDF projects, a country’s institutional quality has a significant positive relationship with it. This article reveals more complex dynamics of EDF implementation than suggested by the political perspective on defence-industrial integration pre-EDF. © Ringailė Kuokštytė, 2024 © Military Academy of Lithuania, 2024.},

	abstract = {Introduction. China started to develop military-to-military ties and defense-industrial cooperation with Latin America and Caribbean countries in the early 2000s as an element of its strategy of comprehensive cooperation with the region. Defense cooperation was mentioned in the Chinese documents and statements on the policy in the region from the early 2000s. However, China has always considered this defense cooperation to be just a secondary, subordinate element of its overall strategy in the region. Methods. The article is based on Chinese publications, statements, and documents concerning China’s policies in defense cooperation with the region, as well as on Latin American and other Western publications on specific cooperation projects. The author compares the Chinese approach to defense cooperation with Latin America to similar Chinese cooperation policies in other regions, especially in Africa. Analysis. China views defense cooperation with Latin America as a subordinate element of its general strategy of economic and political presence in the region. Cultivating ties with the local military elites of Latin America is especially emphasized, and the exchange of military delegations started in the early 2000s. To boost defense cooperation, China is sometimes ready to provide significant military assistance to the region. China has established permanent mechanisms of defense dialogue with the regional countries in the form of regular forums and conferences. Other important venues of militarycooperation include personnel training, joint exercises, and the region’s visits by Chinese warships. China has managed to establish a presence on the arms market in Latin America in the 2000s but has failed to become a major weapons provider in the region. Currently, Chinese arms sales in Latin America are in decline. However, China has achieved major results in the development of dual-use technology cooperation with the LAC countries, especially in the fields of space and internal security. That may create preconditions for faster development of military and military technical cooperation between China and Latin America in the future. So far, the Chinese approach to defense cooperation in the region remains more cautious and gradual compared to cooperation with Africa. China is reluctant to challenge the US red lines here. That may change in the future as China-US relations continue to deteriorate. Authors contributions.

	abstract = {The article examines the features of the formation of military integration between the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe after the Second World War on the basis of documents of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the supreme bodies of state administration. The author consistently analyzes the approaches of the Soviet leadership in this field. Thus, the early period (1945—1950) is characterized by the formation of bilateral military ties and the beginning of cooperation in general. The proposals of the USSR Minister of War and member of the Politburo of the Central Committee N.A. Bulganin, who in 1949 for the first time outlined the basic principles of consolidation of the socialist camp in the field of defense, are important. The second stage of relations (1951—1953) was associated with the emergence of the Coordinating Committee, the first interstate structure designed to strengthen the consolidation of the armed forces of the socialist countries. However, this consolidation led to significant problems, as the socialist countries failed to meet Moscow’s targets for the development of their military-industrial complexes. The third stage of relations (1953—1955) was caused by the beginning of partial conversion of military production and strengthening of specializations in the defense field of individual socialist countries. The latter circumstance finally divided the socialist camp by the mid-1950s into producing countries (USSR, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary) and consuming countries (Bulgaria, Romania, GDR and Albania). In addition, by late 1954 and early 1955, the Soviet leadership and the socialist countries had reached some consensus on the integration of defense efforts. It was decided that all export-import supplies and industrial cooperation were regulated by bilateral agreements, and the general principles of the socialist camp defense organization were discussed at the meetings of the Political Consultative Committee and approved by the Commander-in-Chief and the Headquarters of the United Armed Forces that emerged after the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance in May 1955 and the creation of the Warsaw Pact Organization. At the same time, the study emphasizes that despite a certain dominant role of the Soviet Union in military consolidation, the Kremlin never exerted serious pressure on its allies on the development of individual projects. At the same time, the development of the military-industrial complex in the socialist countries turned out to be important not only in the formation and strengthening of the armed forces of these countries, but also in the development of heavy industry, strengthening the integration of the planned economies of these states into the all-socialist economic-political union of the socialist camp and the creation of an alternative global world order. © 2024 Ltd Integration: Education and Science.

This article takes a network approach to understanding the causes and consequences of offsets in the arms trade. It argues that offset clauses create network ties that affect a state’s position and power in the global arms production network. This depends on the type of offset it pursues—only a small subset of states with advanced technological manufacturing capabilities can maintain a central and powerful position by leveraging direct offsets. Other states must pursue indirect offsets, which have the opposite effect and keep these states locked into peripheral positions of limited power. Through case studies of offset use in India and Malaysia, this article shows how difficult it is to achieve network interdependence (India), and the difficulties of using indirect offsets to achieve political goals (Malaysia). © EPS Publishing, 2024.},

Originating in the second half of the 19th century, defence offsets - additional economic, industrial and technological benefits to states for buying foreign weapons - have since been a key feature of the global arms trade and defence industry. And yet, offsets are an under-researched and under-theorised phenomenon. This book fills this gap in the literature by offering the first general theory of defence offsets, as well as the first systematic analysis of the offset phenomenon. By building on the insights of scholars of defence economics and drawing from the International Relations liberal paradigm, as well as reviving and adapting Robert Putnam's two-level game framework, the book proposes a liberal-rationalist theory of defence offsets. It then proves the worth of such a theory through Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) of fifty-four fighter aircraft transfers from 1992 to 2021 inclusive, and three in-depth case studies addressing offsets negotiated and agreed to as part of fighter aircraft competitions in Brazil, India, and South Korea.

Through qualitative analysis of Malaysian case studies, the paper highlights optimising defence budgets for skills, education and training.

	abstract = {The tuberculosis (TB) burden remains a significant global public health concern, especially in less developed countries. While pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is the most common form of the disease, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, particularly intestinal TB (ITB), which is mostly secondary to PTB, is also a significant issue. With the development of sequencing technologies, recent studies have investigated the potential role of the gut microbiome in TB development. In this review, we summarized studies investigating the gut microbiome in both PTB and ITB patients (secondary to PTB) compared with healthy controls. Both PTB and ITB patients show reduced gut microbiome diversity characterized by reduced Firmicutes and elevated opportunistic pathogens colonization; Bacteroides and Prevotella were reported with opposite alteration in PTB and ITB patients. The alteration reported in TB patients may lead to a disequilibrium in metabolites such as short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, which may recast the lung microbiome and immunity via the “gut-lung axis”. These findings may also shed light on the colonization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the gastrointestinal tract and the development of ITB in PTB patients.

	abstract = {Offsets are agreements or contracts in which the buying country tries to compel the exporting company to reinvest part of the contract value back into the importing country. As defense equipment and systems acquisitions involve large costs for a country, offsets can be a way to balance such costs, improve national technological and industrial development, as well as meet economic and industrial development strategies. However, some countries cannot do this type of contracts, following the European Union Directives, while others continue to use military or defense offsets in a successful way. Lack of effectiveness, efficiency and trust is common in such agreements, dictating a country's loss of wealth and reputation. Therefore, increasing accountability around offset transactions is critical. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of different offset policies by analyzing a sample of failure and success cases. © 2023,Defence S and T Technical Bulletin.

Design/methodology/approach: A novel integrated case study and Straussian grounded theory approach under the interpretative assumptions and purposive sampling in a global defence industry organisation are presented. Findings: The TT is approached from the process modelling point of view, and a detailed operations description covering the end-to-end TT process across a defence industrial participation project is presented. The findings suggest that local recipient’s management, financial resources and planning, supply chain management and local production planning are the main factors of an efficient process. Research limitations/implications: This is a single case study, only reflecting the supplier view. Future research could explore the other dimensions of the process to confirm the identified factors playing a role over time. Originality/value: To date, the body of TT research has focused on the factors influencing the technology absorption and the identification of meta mechanisms between the supplier and recipient organisations in a context of a multinational corporation and as an intra-firm activity, providing little insight to the actual practical operational level TT process. This study seeks to fill this gap by advancing a more profound understanding of the process activities and the main factors through which the local recipient organisation can best influence the project’s success and manage the inter-organisational TT operations more effectively in a highly technologically complex operational environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review to analyze propositions related to offset practices in the international defense market. 73 propositions were identified from the material obtained by means of a systematic review according to Tranfield, Denyer and Smart method, published in 2003. As a result, 46.58% of the identified propositions are directly related to the interest of the Buyer State. This reflects the weight of this actor on the defense offset practice. Buyers’ perspectives are responsible for 16.44% of the identified propositions, while sellers’ perspective represents 21.92% of the propositions. Besides, the seller State point of view is present on 15.07% of the identified propositions. Regarding offset policies, it is observed that some countries impose mandatory defense offsets, however, without an adequate study if the gain brought by the mandatory offset would outweigh the advantages related to the lower prices that could have been negotiated. It was observed that the subordination of the institutions that make the purchases and negotiate the agreements to the superior demands of the States can weaken their position during the negotiations, taking away their bargaining power. This weakness can make the traded product more expensive, although it politically strengthens the decision to purchase selected defense products. In this way, the work contributes to the control and continuous improvement of processes and dynamics related to offset agreements already in progress, as well as future agreements that take place in a perspective of alignment with the interests of national policy and strategies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Economic and trade relations between Russia and Finland have been transforming under the influence of global and regional trends. Russia has always emphasized its interest in enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation with Finland based on investments, technology transfer, industrial cooperation and increasing the share of non-resource non-energy goods in turnover. There is an interest in bringing high-tech and high-quality Finnish industrial products and providing them an opportunity to participate in large-scale public industrial projects. Russia is at the same time a substantial threat and opportunity in Finnish foreign policy. Finland's foreign policy towards Russia is based on two pillars: defense (the need for military deterrence) and economic (the need for broad relations). The main focus of the article is on this second pillar. In fact, so established and sacred was this pillar of foreign policy that the term ‘Finlandisation’ arose, many decades ago, as a description of when a country is induced to favour, or refrain from opposing, the interests of a more powerful country, despite not being politically allied to it. History and geography are two critical factors that have made Finland and Russia inherent economic partners. Finland's management of relations with Russia is a unique example that has set an example for many countries worldwide. The economic integration between Finland and Russia has occurred almost by itself without any tremendous public effort. However, determination in policy-making can help integrate Finland and Russia's economies even further. The complicated relations with Russia can be seen as Finland's historical dilemma: neighboring Russia but now a part of the West, Finland's room for maneuver is not self-evident and requires constant management. Research Question: All things considered, it begs the question in this regard, it begs the question how have economic factors affected the direction of Finland's foreign policy towards Russia? Examining the order of this process is also essential. Research Hypothesis: This article hypothesizes that energy, along with trade in goods and services, are the most important economic variables that have led to the pursuit of resilience and normative strategies, resulting in mutual vulnerability in Finnish-Russian interactions. Methodology (and Theoretical Framework if there are): The paper uses the theory of asymmetric interdependence based on Keohen and Nye vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the economy is sensitive to the extent that it is exposed to costs inflicted from the outside before policies are introduced to change the situation; it is vulnerable to the extent that it is exposed to costs inflicted from the outside after policies have been applied. If outside costs can be imposed on a country in the form of higher prices for a commodity that is important to its economy, for instance, oil, then that country is sensitive. Suppose the country has some means to change this situation, either by switching its source of imports using trade sanctions in some way by military force. Then it is not vulnerable. If prices of these commodities go up and the country can do nothing about it, it is both sensitive and vulnerable. This distinction can be beneficial when dealing with economic interdependence. Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can represent the entire population or a sample of a population. The research method is a combination of descriptive statistics and field research. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread). Descriptive statistics, in short, help describe and understand the features of a specific data set by giving short summaries about the sample and measures of the data. Results and discussion: Russia offer significant opportunities for the Finnish business sector. Finland's trade has overgrown in the 2000s, and Russia is becoming Finland's most important trade partner. Conclusion: The study's findings suggest that Russia is using energy to advance its policies towards Finland with a geo-economics approach. Finland is also vulnerable in trade in goods, but it has the upper hand in services. The sum of these two constants has led to interdependence in the relationship between them. Besides Finnish Russian trade's development, the business between the two affects more. Among the other cities in the development corridor, Finnish knowledge and competitiveness help Northern Europe's economic development. A recession outcome would need an escalation in war and/or more severe deterioration in energy and raw material markets. Nonetheless, growth will decline and inflation will spike. © 2022,Central Eurasia Studies. All Rights Reserved.},

Background: There have been numerous studies comparing various aspects of bariatric surgery, such as hand sewn vs stapled anastomoses, electronic vs manual staplers, and reinforced vs nonreinforced staple lines. There has never been a randomized controlled trial comparing different staplers in sleeve gastrectomies. Methods: Our study was a randomized control trial comparing the staple reload time, complications, and stapler cost for the Medtronic I-Drive and the Ethicon Echelon. Our primary endpoints were time, hemostasis, bleeding, necessity for transfusion, and leak rate in a military system. Results: Sixty-three patients were consented for the study with a final number of 26 in the Echelon arm and 25 in the I-Drive arm after fallout. There were a total of 140 stapler reloads in the Echelon arm and 123 in the I-Drive arm. The median staple reload times were 39.78 seconds for the I-Drive and 41.77 seconds for the Echelon (p = 0.42). The total time for sleeve creation was 12.14 minutes in the Echelon arm and 14.26 minutes in the I-Drive arm (p = 0.04). There were two misfires in each group (four total) and no positive leak tests, transfusions, or postoperative complications. The average cost for staplers, reloads, and reinforcement for the I-Drive was $2,037.26 for the civilian rate and $2,097.66 for the government rate. The average cost for the Echelon was $1,835.65 for the civilian rate and $2,268.97 for the government rate. Conclusion: The Medtronic I-Drive and the Ethicon Echelon are comparable in reload time, stapler misfires, leak test rates, and cost.

	abstract = {Introduction: While inflammation is an important innate defense mechanism against infection, it can also lead to local tissue damage. The trans signaling pathway of interleukin (IL)-6 is a known mediator of inflammation. We hypothesized that the trans IL-6 signaling pathway is associated with the development of post febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) renal scarring. Objective: To compare soluble regulators of trans IL-6 signaling between patients with a history of febrile UTI who do or do not have renal scarring. Study design: After IRB-approval, we collected urine samples in pediatric patients with a history of febrile (≥38 °C) UTI (urine culture >50 K uropathogen) with documented presence or absence of renal scarring on imaging. Samples were collected at a time when patients were not actively infected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed on samples for markers of trans IL-6 signaling: IL-6, soluble (s) IL-6 receptor (R), and soluble (s)gp130, a buffer in trans IL-6 signaling. Values were normalized to urine creatinine. Results were analyzed by t-test or Mann–Whitney U. Spearman rank correlation was used. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 50 urines from patients with a history of febrile UTI were collected: 23 with and 27 without scarring. There was no difference between groups regarding age or gender. There was no significant difference in urine IL-6, sIL-6R, or sgp130 between those with and without scarring (Figure). While IL-6 values significantly correlated with sIL-6R and sgp130 in those without renal scarring, IL-6 did not correlate with sgp130 in those with scarring. Ratios of IL-6 to sgp130 and sIL-6R to sgp130 were not different between groups. Discussion: The inflammatory response generated in response to infection is believed to be largely responsible for the development of renal scarring after UTI. IL-6 is a cytokine known to be induced during UTI with a pro-inflammatory pathway, known as trans signaling. This study investigated for differences in markers of trans IL-6 signaling between patients with a history of febrile UTI with and without renal scarring. There was no significant difference between the absolute values or ratio of these markers between groups. Conclusions: Markers of trans IL-6 signaling are not different between individuals with a history of febrile UTI with and without renal scarring in the non-acute setting.[Formula presented] © 2020 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company},

The present article introduces market size as a variable to elucidate different first and second-tier states’ approaches towards European defence-industrial cooperation.

The research approach used is a qualitative approach. This type of research is a systematic review research. Likewise, the defense industry of a country reflects the economic strength of its country, because in carrying out the defense function, the defense industry has a very important role, including in holding the national Main Tool of the Armament System. However, now not all defense equipment can be produced by the domestic defense industry, so some defense equipment must still be held in cooperation with foreign countries. Law No. 16 of 2012 concerning the Defense Industry mandates that procurement of defense equipment from abroad be permitted if it fulfills several requirements, including trade returns, local content, and offset. Counter trade is one of the mechanisms of cooperation that has been carried out by Indonesia. This mechanism allows reciprocal trade between two countries by buying goods from abroad with payment in the form of goods worth the goods imported. So it is important to analyze the potential for economic improvement for Indonesia that is generated by the mechanism of trade defense equipment from abroad, so that in conducting cooperation, Indonesia can benefit both in the short and long term. © Sciedu Press.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years there have been important initiatives to favour greater harmonization among EU member states' defence-industrial policies. However, EU countries sometimes decide to cooperate in the development of defence-industrial projects, to maintain defence procurement on a national basis or to import extra-EU armaments. To investigate the simultaneous presence of cooperation and competition, focusing on how the process of differentiated integration shapes European defence-industrial governance, this paper assesses Italian participation in two major European armaments organizations (OCCAR and the European Defence Agency), as well in two new EU initiatives in this sector (PeSCo and the European Defence Fund). Specifically, this analysis focuses on national state-arms industry relations as a crucial explanatory variable in the formation of Italy's preferences towards defence-industrial cooperation. © 2019 European Review of International Studies.

	abstract = {Singapore is a tiny island state that since independence from the British in 1965 has managed to develop a formidable defence-industrial base. Singapore’s policymakers prefer to use the term defence ‘ecosystem’, as it more aptly captures all the diverse elements contributing to arms production capacity, within and beyond, the industrial base. This is often referred to as technological absorption capability, and includes specialist supply chains, R&D institutions, skilled engineering and design personnel and high technology universities. As part of a conceptualised model highlighting the principal facets in the development of Singapore’s defence-industrial ecosystem, this chapter examines the importance of proactive government strategy, treating the core defence company, ST Engineering, as a strategic industry. Technology development is fostered via indigenous R&D investment, foreign technological partnerships and defence offset. This unique defence-industrial model is framed within the country’s ‘Total Defence’ policy, emphasising the significance of technological development through civil-military integration. Singapore’s defence-industrial eco-system is a success story, and offers the potential for emulation by other emerging states seeking accelerated defence industrialisation. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Keith Hartley and Jean Belin; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {In the present time, incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) becomes broader, due to spreading resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) to anti-tuberculosis drugs and infection with highly virulent strains of M. tuberculosis. The MBT antigens can cause dysfunction of the receptors and modulate the cytokine secreting function of immunocompetent cells. Polymorphic genes of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the mechanisms of defense responses of innate immunity, determine the degree of resistance to individual mycobacterial infection, as well as severity and duration of the disease in cases of clinical manifestations. The aim of the study was to investigate the connections between allelic polymorphisms of IL2, IFNG and TNFA genes and changes in secretion of the corresponding pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IFNγ, and TNFα in vitro in patients with the newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), depending on the clinical form of the disease. A total of 334 patients (220 men and 114 women) aged 23 to 50 years with newly diagnosed infiltrative and disseminated TB were enrolled into the study. The control group consisted of 183 healthy donors (130 men and 53 women) of corresponding age. The material of the research included DNA extracted from the whole blood and supernatants of culture suspensions of mononuclear leukocytes isolated from venous blood in healthy volunteers and patients with TB. The evaluation of cytokines secretion was performed by measuring their concentration in the blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants. using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To study polymorphic regions of cytokine genes, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied. Analysis of the obtained data was carried out by means of the program Statistica for Windows Version 6.0 (StatSoft Inc., USA). It was found that the imbalance of secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in TB patients was associated with the polymorphic variants of genes of these cytokines. It was found that the hypo-secretion of IL-2 is determined by the carriage of the G allele and genotype GG (T-330G) of the IL2 gene in both the control group and in patients with TB, regardless of the clinical form. In patients with DTB carriers of the homozygous genotype TT (T-330G) of the IL2 gene, increased protein secretion was established. The maximum secretion of TNFб was recorded in patients with the AA genotype (G-308A) of the TNFA gene in the control group and in ITB patients; the minimum concentration of TNFα was associated with the carrier of the homozygous GG genotype (G-308A) of the TNFA gene in all the examined groups. In patients with ITB and DTB, an increase in IFNγ secretion by mononuclear blood leukocytes is not associated with the carrier of polymorphism +874A/T of the IFNG gene. Reduced secretion of IL-2 and TNFα in TB patients is associated with polymorphisms of their genes – (T-330G) of IL2 gene and (G-308A) of TNFA gene, respectively. The polymorphism (+874A/T) of the IFNG gene does not have a modulatory effect on the secretion of IFNγ in patients with TB, regardless of clinical form of the disease. © 2019, SPb RAACI},

Nevertheless, the European defence-industrial panorama still continues to be characterized by both cooperation and conflict. Protectionism, oligopolistic market straining and primary resource to domestic suppliers have prevented a more structured defence-industrial cooperation. The aim of this article is to add empirical evidence to recent academic works that highlighted how relative gains play a key role in understanding the simultaneous presence of cooperation and conflict in the European security architecture. In doing so, this analysis focuses on the European defence-industrial landscape and specifically on British, French and Italian preferences towards armaments cooperation. To preview the conclusions, France, Italy and the UK have constantly pursued greater intra-European cooperation, in order to increase their power within the international defence-industrial market. However, they have refused to participate in European defence-industrial initiatives when other countries would have a greater advantage from this cooperation. This happened despite strong geopolitical and strategic incentives to cooperate. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The chapter shows that, while the major powers dominate defence industrial cooperation both at the government and at the corporate level, the lesser powers and smaller defence firms follow the trend and participate in the supply chains of large weaponry.

	abstract = {Introduction: Olecranon bursitis (OB) is a benign but disturbing condition that may adversely affect a military recruit’s combat preparedness. This study was designed to assess incidence, risk factors, and associated medical burden of OB in the Israel Defense Forces. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study drawing on medical records of all Israel Defense Forces soldiers diagnosed as having OB between 2005 and 2015. OB was classified as septic and noninfectious. Crude incidence rates and duty-specific incidence rates were calculated. Medical burden was defined by the number of physician visits, referrals to orthopedic specialist consultations, duration of symptoms, and duration of pharmaceutical treatment. Demographic and occupational information (age, sex, height, weight, socioeconomic status, country of origin, type of military service, time of presentation to medical services) was used to identify risk factors for septic bursitis and longer duration of symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed in R statistical software. Risk factors were evaluated using the Chi-square test for categorical variables and Pearson correlation coefficients were used for continuous variables. The study was approved by the Israeli Defense Force IRB. Results: A total of 2,692 soldiers were diagnosed with OB during the study period. The crude annual incidence rate of OB was 29/100,000 person-years (PY). Combat duty had an incidence of 97/100,000 PY, and noncombat duties had an incidence of 12/10,000 PY (p < 0.001). Female incidence (8.4/100,000 PY) was similar to male incidence (11/100,000 PY) in administrative duties (p = 0.54). More cases were diagnosed during summer and autumn than in other seasons (p = 0.016). Septic bursitis constituted 24% of all cases, was more frequent in combat soldiers (32%), and on average presented earlier in service than noninfectious OB (13 vs. 17 weeks since recruitment). The mean duration of symptoms was estimated at 17.58 weeks, with a mean of 1.75 physician visits per soldier. About 19% received a specialist referral. Origin from the former USSR was associated with a higher duration of symptoms (p = 0.012). Conclusion: Type of military service was the principal risk factor for OB, as indicated by a higher incidence of the disorder among combat compared to noncombat units, possibly the result of field training without protective gear and repetitive trauma to elbows. The greater number of diagnoses of OB during summer and autumn, when training is more intensive, support that explanation. Sex did not affect incidence of OB in administrative units. The medical burden appears to be relatively low, since most of the soldiers had only one physician visit. OB is highly prevalent in military compared to civilian populations. Outdoor training involving crawling is a probable explanation for the much higher rates among combat units and increased number of diagnoses during warm summer and autumn months. Prevention by use of protective gear seems to be the most promising intervention. © AMSUS - The Society of Federal Health Professionals, 2017.},

	abstract = {Introduction Defense mechanisms have been seen to greatly change over time and across different definitions made by different theoretical currents. Recently with the definition provided by the DSM IV, defense mechanisms have integrated the concept of coping as a defensive factor. These mechanisms are no longer considered just through a psychodynamic approach but also through a cognitive and behavioral one. In recent years, new theories have therefore integrated these two components of the defensive operation. According to Chabrol and Callahan (2013), defense mechanisms precede coping strategies. In individuals with psychopathological disorders, these authors indicate a relative stability of these mechanisms. Also, we asked about the presence of unique characteristics among people with alcohol dependence. Indeed, studies conducted with people with alcohol dependence highlight the presence of a neurotic defense style and some highly immature defenses (projection, acting out, splitting and somatization). In terms of coping strategies, persons with alcohol dependence preferentially use avoidant strategies and strategies focused on emotion. However, although several studies have been conducted to assess coping strategies and defense styles within a population of individuals with an alcohol problem, at the present time none of them has taken into account all these aspects of defense mechanisms. Objective The aim of this study is therefore to study the defenses and defense styles and coping strategies in an alcohol-dependent population. Method This multicenter study (3 CHU, 1 center of supportive care and prevention in addiction and 1 clinic) received a favorable opinion of an Institutional Review Board (IRB Registration #: 00001072). Eighty alcohol-dependent individuals responded to a questionnaire assessing sociodemographic characteristics and elements related to the course of consumption. Coping strategies were assessed by means of a questionnaire validated in French: the Brief Cope. The Defense Style Questionnaire-40 translated into French, but not validated, assessed defenses and defense style. Descriptive, comparative and correlational analysis was carried out using Statistica software – version 10. Results The alcohol-dependent people preferentially use emotion focused coping blame and less the problem focused coping humor. The highest immature defense is acting out. Correlational analyses confirm the presence of some significant relationships between defense style and some coping strategies. Thus, the mature style is the only defense style, which is linked with the problem focused strategy humor, and another one coping called distraction. Some singular relationships were found with these two dimensions of coping. Alcohol and drug disengagement show particularly strong relationships with immature defenses such as projection and somatization. Another singular result is indicated by a negative relationship between immature defenses autistic fantasy with the strategy expression of feelings. Conclusion This study found a significant number of relationships between defensive styles, defenses and coping strategies. This research also highlights the value of an integrative approach of defense mechanisms for the analysis of defensive functioning of people with alcohol dependence. Indeed, the relationships between these elements are consistent and allow understanding the defensive operation as a whole to promote a new adapted means of support. © 2016 L'Encéphale, Paris},

The few conducted concentrated on developed countries, which are exporters of arms. This study examines the short-run and long-run impact of arms importation on the economic growth in Nigeria, using autoregressive distributed lag model. Literature on defense expenditure and economic growth are often conflicting and inconclusive. These outcomes are due to the non-linear growth effects of defense and incorrect model specifications. The crucial growth effects of defense expenditure can be traced by properly controlling the interaction term. This paper examines the defense-arms interaction on Nigeria in the context of Aizeiman and Glick (2006) models. The result reveals that defense-arms interaction in Nigeria exerts negatively on the economic growth. It therefore recommends that defense R and D as well Defense Industrial Cooperation of Nigeria should be properly financed and managed for efficiency and self-reliability. © 2016, Econjournals.

Offsets are usually expected to yield technological or industrial benefits to the purchasing country (e.g. countertrade, technology transfers, or additional jobs) and military buyers often require suppliers to make offsets available "cost-free." The authors argued previously that such strategies achieve little of value to buyers that lack market power and are unnecessary otherwise, since purchasers with the market power to extract more value for money from foreign suppliers can do so anyway. This article also focuses on the supply side of offset deals. The USA is the world's largest defence offsets supplier but the US government opposes offsets demands as economically inefficient and trade distorting. Even if offsets are inefficient and trade distorting, they may still benefit a materiel-exporting country such as the USA as they may induce exports and create associated benefits for the offsets provider. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

Particular attention is given to the offset-relevant regulation and practice and to their recent evolution in the EU following the adoption of European Directive on defence and security procurement (81/81/EC). Offsets play a dual role with regard to the integration of defence industries: on one hand they can be trade-distorting and contribute to the survival of inefficient suppliers in arms importing countries; on the other hand, they can contribute in overcoming barriers that may otherwise prevent some potentially efficient suppliers from accessing the supply chains of the big system integrators. The chapter draws the attention on the need to complement the regulatory evolution by further initiatives aiming at improving the access of non-incumbent suppliers to the supply chains of the large defence system integrators. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This chapter explores the role and relevance of defence offsets policy in India's expanding defence industrial environment. It argues that India's offsets policy will probably fail to realize the long-term benefits it anticipates unless the conditions for ensuring viable and sustainable development are secured, particularly given the relative technological immaturity of India's defence economy. The hypothesis is examined by exploring the evolving offsets phenomenon against India's unique defence industrial conditions. The author also seeks to evaluate offsets performance during the early decades of India's post-Independence defence industrial development. Based on a review of contemporary comparative 'best' (offset) practices, several weaknesses of India's offsets policy are identified. These are weighed against the huge market leverage that India's burgeoning defence market can bring to ensure progress towards defence industrial self-reliance. Finally, it offers policy recommendations on the Indian offset experience. © Oxford University Press 2014. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Congress and the Obama Administration are seeking to manage longstanding bilateral and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-based defense cooperation with Turkey at a time when a more independent Turkish foreign policy course and changes in regional security conditions are creating new challenges for both countries. Defense cooperation rooted in shared threat perceptions from the Cold War era and built on close U.S. ties with the Turkish military leadership now must be reconciled with a decline of the military's political influence in Turkish society and some negative turns in Turkish popular sentiment toward the United States over the past decade. At the same time, Turkey's importance as a U.S. ally has arguably increased on issues of global significance in its surrounding region that include Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In early 2011, Turkey's regional role has arguably become even more prominent-exemplified by its significant involvement politically and militarily on the question of NATO's intervention in Libya. How Congress and the Administration manage defense cooperation with Turkey in this evolving context is likely to have a significant bearing on U.S. national security interests, as well as on both U.S. and Turkish calculations of the mutual benefits and leverage involved in the coo-perative relationship. Some officials and analysts believe that, in at least some respects, the United States needs Turkey more than Turkey needs the United States. Others counter that claims of Turkish leverage over the United States are exaggerated. Possible general congressional and Administration approaches to U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation ("Possible U.S. Policy Approaches") include • avoiding major recharacterizations of the alliance, while emphasizing and expressing confidence that existing NATO and bilateral relationships-with their long legacies-can address mutual security challenges; • according high priority to the alliance and revising expectations for it by accommodating new developments within and outside of Turkey; • linking cooperation in some way to Turkey's relations with certain third-party countries or non-state actors-including Iran, Israel, Hamas, Armenia, and China-or to Turkish actions on issues of U.S. national security interest; and • using or combining any of these approaches on a case-by-case basis. Specific issues that remain of significant importance for Congress (see "Specific Issues and Possible Options for Congress"), given its au-thority to appropriate funds, review major arms sales, consider non-binding resolutions, and provide general oversight include the following: • Continued military access to Turkish bases and transport corridors: The ongoing availability to the United States and NATO of Turkish bases and transport corridors-which have been used heavily for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya-is valuable and remains a possible point of contention and leverage. The extent of its importance and of alternatives may be subject to further analysis. • Future of Turkey-Israel relations: U.S. efforts to maintain alliances with both Turkey and Israel could be made more complicated if relations between them do not improve-potentially influencing the regional security environment. • Missile defense radar: Whether Turkey agrees in 2011 to host a U.S. forward-deployed radar for missile defense as part of the NATO system may depend on its perceptions of whether doing so would be more likely to cultivate stability or to be unduly provocative to neighboring countries. • Arms sales and industrial cooperation: Turkey continues to seek advanced military equipment from U.S. sources, particularly with respect to fighter and drone aircraft, helicopters, and missile defense systems (see "Arms Sales and Industrial Coo-peration"). At the same time, Turkey is increasingly diversifying its defense contacts and procurement relationships with non-NATO countries. • Military and security assistance: Although the United States no longer provides major annual grant aid to Turkey's military, assistance continues to foster cooperation on counterterrorism, law enforcement, and military training and education. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This chapter reviews official offset audits conducted in 1995 (Sweden) and 1999 (Finland) and applies its own criteria of what an offset audit should cover. The official audits point to numerous difficulties involved in the administration, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of offsets, and the achievement of offset policy goals. Direct military offsets to support defense policy goals are relatively easy to specify, fulfill, implement, monitor, and evaluate. Their main limitation is their short contract duration. The use of indirect military offsets to support defense policy goals is more difficult to specify and implement but could, in principle, be designed toward long-term objectives. Indirect civil offsets are also difficult to specify and implement and are very difficult to monitor and evaluate. It may be more expedient to design a number of well defined indirect offset projects than to demand a high offset share. © 2004 Editorial matter, selection, and introduction Jurgen Brauer & J.Paul Dunne; individual chapters, the contributors.

Dr Ozlu has been appointed deputy undersecretary in charge of financial and administrative affairs, as he replaced Ismail Tohumcu. Ismail Tohumcu has been appointed deputy undersecretary in charge of offsets and industrial participation. The moves at the SSM have also affected lower levels, where directors in charge of various projects have also changed positions. The SSM and AgustaWestland signed an agrrement in September 2007 for the production of 51 Mangusta AW 129 attack helicopters in Turkey.},

The country has taken such a decision, as its Defense Ministry is struggling with its latest purchasing planning,due to lack of funds for the Tranche 3 purchase program. It is expected that any reduction in number of Typhoons can undermine fundamental agreement between partner states, as production workshare on the multirole fighter is directly connected to acquisition objectives. Another significant factor is that, the decision by the country, to buy fewer aircrafts and spend more money on enhanced capabilities, will require approval from the other three Eurofighter states. A sole decision, to reduce the number of such aircrafts will require that the country compensates the other partner states for such losses.},

Bulgin described in a report named Background to Industrial Participation, that the UK offset or Industrial Participation (IP) program is focused entirely on leveraging work into the UK defense sector that is principally concerned with the created employment.

	abstract = {Future commercial and government space initiatives may often be so financially demanding, technically difficult, and organizationally complex that they will require creation of international industrial partnerships. Although harmony with a wide variety of systems of law, regulation, and policy may at times prove challenging, the success of current global ventures proves that such challenges can be effectively met. The experience of numerous companies might be cited, but one need look no further than the international experience of The Boeing Company for useful illustrations of cooperative potential. The commercial Sea Launch consortium is a prime example of integrating the special contributions of a variety of companies from countries around the world. Boeing's capabilities are blended with Russian and Ukrainian competencies (MSC Energia, SDO Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash), as well as Norwegian expertise (Aker ASA). Another partnership of note involves Boeing and the Japanese firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which has created value in aviation, launch vehicles, and ISS development. Also noteworthy is Boeing's innovative collaboration with the Italian firm Finmeccanica, both outside the space sector and with Alcatel Alenia Space Italia (AAS-I) in International Space Station (ISS) development. In addition, Boeing has enjoyed a positive working relationship with the Canadian company MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates (MBA), involving robotics associated with the Orbital Express program, funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and involving Earth-orbit autonomous rendezvous and docking. Another Canadian company, Optech, is partnered with MDA for space LIDAR systems, which use lasers to characterize distance and surface characteristics. Looking toward the future, companies are considering possibilities for expanded involvement in space exploration and commerce. Significant potential for future international collaboration appears evident. Boeing is chairing a series of space commerce roundtable meetings, where global industry leaders have the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with space community representatives regarding potential business opportunities. Also potentially contributing to future international collaboration is the effort by RSC Energia, one of the Sea Launch team members, to create new human space transportation capabilities building on decades of experience with the Soyuz system. In addition, MHI's proposed HTV vehicle, while designed for ISS cargo support, may also be viewed as a testbed for later development of vehicles and platforms with capacity for transit to the Moon and other more distant destinations. MHI has a number of capabilities that could support design, fabrication, and operation of space infrastructure as well as transportation, involving both human and robotic systems. Similarly, Alcatel Alenia has explored application of ISS experience with pressurized modules to development of new space structures, such as NASA's Crew Exploration Vehicle and potential lunar surface installations. Engineering of commercial and government habitation systems, taking into account technical, ergonomic, and aesthetic considerations relevant to the placement and architecture of surface structures, could clearly benefit from such expertise. Beyond this, MDA and Optech have partnered on a variety of projects, including one particularly relevant to future space activities on celestial bodies: precision landing and hazard avoidance. Such Canadian competencies may play a key role in civil, security, and commercial systems of the future. Considering these and other successful industrial partnerships, it is clear that expansion of human and robotic presence in space cam be a truly global enterprise.

	abstract = {Offsets or industrial participation have become an increasingly important part of arms procurement, with the promise of economic benefits often being an important justification for spending large amounts of public money. However, the limited but growing research on the subject casts doubt on the net value of defence offsets to national economies. An important aspect af any offset agreement is its impact at the regional and local levels. This paper contributes to the continuing debate on the topic, by undertaking a case study of the South African experience, focusing on the Coega Industrial Development Zone, which is situated on the coast some 22 kilometres north-east of Port Elizabeth. The endurance of the Coega IDZ (Industrial Development Zone) project in the face of considerable national criticism from business, other provinces, and civil society, can be explained in part by its identification as the flagship of the NIP (National Industrial Participation) programme, and its reciprocal role in helping the private and public justification of the Strategic Defence Programme (SDP). The study finds that industrial participation schemes do attract and focus investment, but that they also deform efforts at more integrated development at sub-national levels, and further fragment the terrain for industrial policy conceptualisation. It suggests that the offsets targeted for the Eastern Cape do relatively little to address backlogs in development in the region. © 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
