# Methodology

We will use a blended method designed for complex policy questions where outcomes depend heavily on context. First, we will run a realist evidence synthesis to explain how and why offset and industrial participation policies interact with alliance priorities such as interoperability, readiness and security of supply. Realist synthesis is appropriate here because “offsets” are not a single, standard intervention: they cover a range of tools (for example workshare, technology transfer, co-production, multipliers, and governance requirements) that operate differently in different procurement systems and security environments. Rather than asking whether offsets are “good” or “bad” in general, the realist component will identify the main causal pathways that the literature describes and test them against the evidence, focusing on what tends to work, for whom, and under what conditions.

The realist synthesis will be structured using a simple “context–mechanism–outcome” logic. We will extract from each source: (i) the context (such as whether offsets are mandatory or voluntary; direct or indirect; the sensitivity of the technology; export control constraints; the maturity of the domestic industrial base; and whether procurement is part of a multinational programme), (ii) the mechanism (the process through which the policy is expected to produce effects, such as creating incentives for supply-chain integration, building local sustainment capacity, or, conversely, increasing opacity and broker involvement), and (iii) the outcomes (observable effects relevant to a NATO-aligned posture, such as standardisation and interoperability, delivery speed and readiness, resilience and security of supply, or partnership frictions such as delays, supplier withdrawal, or political controversy). This approach allows us to distinguish what the evidence shows, what it claims, and where findings are contested or depend on specific conditions.

In parallel, we will conduct a structured comparative case mapping exercise to answer the “which countries” questions. This second component is necessary because the evidence base on offsets is spread across academic studies, official policy documents, audits, legal commentary, and case reporting, and countries often use different labels for similar practices (industrial participation, industrial cooperation, IRB/ITB, localisation). Case mapping will not produce a league table. Instead, it will use a consistent rubric to compare a short list of relevant countries and programmes on a small set of dimensions: the design of the offset/industrial participation policy; the depth of industrial collaboration achieved (from subcontracting through to licensed production, co-production, co-development and shared sustainment); markers of alliance and programme integration (for example standardisation, shared sustainment arrangements, and participation in multinational programmes); and documented risks or frictions (such as corruption vulnerabilities, export-control deadlock, cost/schedule impacts, or partnership disputes). Each case will be assigned an evidence confidence judgement based on the quality and transparency of the underlying sources.

The literature search will be designed to avoid missing relevant evidence because of inconsistent terminology. We will use a two-lane search strategy. One lane will focus on offsets and industrial participation directly (including their common synonyms), and the other will focus on alliance-relevant industrial cooperation and interoperability outcomes, where the term “offset” may not appear. We will search academic databases and targeted repositories, but will also systematically include high-value grey literature (government policy and guidance, audit reports, NATO/EU/EDA material, and reputable governance and anti-corruption analysis), because many of the most informative “hinderance” and risk cases are documented outside journals. Screening decisions will be based on pre-specified inclusion criteria (defence procurement relevance, time period, and presence of identifiable mechanisms and outcomes), not simply on whether “alliance” language appears in the abstract.

Finally, synthesis will be reported in two linked outputs. The realist synthesis will provide a set of evidence-backed statements about mechanisms and conditions—what types of offset design appear compatible with NATO-aligned outcomes, what designs are associated with recurring risks, and which mitigation measures are credible. The comparative case mapping will provide a transparent set of positive, negative, and mixed cases with short explanatory notes that connect each case back to the realist mechanisms. Taken together, this approach produces policy-useful conclusions while staying honest about what the evidence can and cannot prove: it supports reasoned judgements about design choices and trade-offs, rather than overstating causal certainty or implying that cross-country experiences are directly comparable in all respects.

## Search Strategy

We used a targeted, two-lane search strategy designed to reflect how this topic is discussed in practice. Defence offsets are often written about as “industrial participation”, “industrial cooperation”, “industrial and regional benefits” (IRB/ITB), “workshare”, “local content”, or “localisation”, while alliance outcomes are more commonly described in terms of “interoperability”, “standardisation”, “security of supply”, “readiness”, “sustainment”, and “supply-chain resilience”. To avoid missing relevant evidence because of inconsistent terminology, we searched in parallel for (i) the offsets/industrial participation literature and (ii) the alliance-relevant defence-industrial cooperation and interoperability literature, then screened and coded results against the review questions.

The first lane focused on offsets and industrial participation directly. Searches combined defence procurement terms (defence/defense, defence procurement, military procurement) with offset/IP synonyms (defence/defense offsets, industrial participation, industrial cooperation, industrial compensation, IRB/ITB, workshare, local content, localisation). From this broad set, we ran focused searches that added one additional concept at a time rather than requiring multiple concepts simultaneously. These focused variants targeted (a) durable industrial collaboration mechanisms (co-development, co-production, licensed production, technology transfer, joint ventures, shared sustainment/MRO and supply-chain integration), (b) risks and governance issues (corruption and transparency risks, intermediaries/brokers, export-control friction including ITAR, compliance, delays and cost impacts, market distortion and programme fragmentation), and (c) comparative or case-based evidence (case study, country, comparative, typology, policy regime). This staged approach was used because requiring many concepts to appear together in titles and abstracts can produce false “no evidence” signals even when relevant work exists.

The second lane focused on alliance-relevant outcomes and defence-industrial cooperation, recognising that many sources discuss interoperability and industrial integration without using the term “offset”. These searches combined defence-industrial cooperation terms (defence industrial cooperation/collaboration, defence industry, industrial cooperation) with alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability, standardisation, security of supply, readiness, sustainment/MRO, and supply chains). We then used follow-on searches to connect this literature back to offset-related mechanisms by adding terms such as workshare, local content, technology transfer, co-production, licensed production, and industrial participation. NATO-specific keywords (NATO, alliance, Euro-Atlantic, coalition, multinational programme) were used selectively as a secondary narrowing step rather than as a primary filter, because many relevant studies treat alliance integration implicitly through standards, shared sustainment arrangements, or procurement coordination rather than naming NATO directly.

We conducted searches in Scopus and Google Scholar for peer-reviewed and academic-adjacent evidence, and we also searched NATO-related sources (including NATO websites and library-style repositories) using shorter keyword bundles that reflect the limited Boolean functionality of many institutional search tools. In addition, we systematically searched grey literature because many of the most informative sources on risks, failures, and governance—particularly corruption vulnerabilities, audit findings, programme delays, and export-control constraints—are documented outside academic journals. Grey literature searching used targeted repository and “site:” searches across national governments and procurement agencies, audit and parliamentary bodies, NATO and allied institutions, and reputable policy and governance organisations. Across all channels we prioritised material published from 2000 onwards, while retaining older “anchor” sources where they were repeatedly cited or essential to understanding terminology and mechanisms.

All results were screened for relevance using operational criteria aligned to the review questions rather than relying on the presence of specific keywords. Sources were included if they addressed offsets/industrial participation or closely related industrial cooperation tools in defence procurement and contained identifiable mechanisms, contextual conditions, and alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability/standardisation, readiness, security of supply, sustainment integration) or documented partnership frictions (such as supplier withdrawal, deal failure, delays, disputes, corruption allegations, or export-control deadlocks). This approach ensures the evidence base is broad enough to capture real-world policy experience while still being structured around the mechanisms and outcomes needed to answer the five research questions.
