How do policy design choices (mandatory vs. voluntary, direct vs. indirect, transparency/enforcement) shape collaboration depth and risk profiles across cases?

# Evidence Used

This synthesis draws on the CMO corpus entries that are explicitly mapped to 'rq3' in `data/cmo/*.yml` and are citation-mapped via `data/cmo/pdf_to_bibtex_key.yml`.

- RQ3-coded CMOs reviewed: 563
- Outcome families represented: 11
- Confidence profile (as recorded in the CMO YAML): 408 high; 152 medium; 3 low

# Synthesis By Outcome Family

Outcome families are used here as a stable, cross-document way to group outcome tendencies while keeping traceability to the underlying CMO evidence.

## Policy and Institutional Dynamics

- **Outcome family description**: Adoption, persistence, termination, or redesign of offset regimes; durable institutional or regulatory shifts.
- **Pathway**: Across cases, design choices appear to evolve from rigid, mandatory percentage schemes toward more flexible/negotiated approaches when high headline obligations and unclear evaluability generate policy stress (including non-fulfilment) and when governments seek designs that better align obligations with feasible delivery and monitoring. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @antonakisOffsetBenefitsGreek1996; @fergussonSearchStrategyEvolution1996]
- **Moderators**: Urgency of supply and bargaining position (buyer leverage vs. constrained choice) condition whether governments insist on mandatory offsets or relax toward pragmatic “best-efforts”/case-by-case arrangements, and whether offset demands are treated as central or secondary to procurement urgency. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996]
- **Counterclaims**: “Voluntary” can be nominal: in some markets, buyers may not formally require offsets but still expect a substantial proposal, preserving offset-like bargaining dynamics and associated risks. [@redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Design implications**: Where the policy goal is deeper collaboration with manageable risk, the evidence points toward (i) fewer, more specified obligations; (ii) clearer additionality rules; and (iii) enforceability/verification capacity, rather than escalating headline percentages. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]
- **Strength of evidence**: Moderate.

## Governance, Compliance and Evaluation

- **Outcome family description**: Monitoring, fulfilment, enforceability, credit accounting, transparency, disputes, auditing, and evaluability/evaluation quality.
- **Pathway**: Design choices around transparency and enforcement shape risk primarily through *credibility of delivery* and *auditability*: weak enforcement (reliance on reputation/“future bids”) plus complex crediting/multiplier/banking rules increases non-fulfilment and gaming risk and makes outcomes harder to verify; stronger enforcement tools (explicit criteria and contractual damages) can tighten compliance but raise administrative burden. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @martinIntroductionOverview1996; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Moderators**: Buyer governance capacity (ability to specify additionality, access audit information, and credibly apply penalties) and the degree of rule complexity condition whether “strict” designs improve delivery or simply thicken transaction costs and disputes. [@markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]
- **Counterclaims**: Even without hard penalties, repeat-business incentives can operate as an enforcement mechanism (especially where suppliers value future access), implying compliance risk is design- and market-dependent rather than purely legalistic. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]
- **Design implications**: For lower-risk delivery, the evidence favors (i) clear, ex ante criteria for what counts; (ii) limits on banking/credit inflation; (iii) proof-of-causality requirements; and (iv) credible remedies for non-performance (where feasible). [@markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @martinIntroductionOverview1996; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Strength of evidence**: Strong.

- Rating: **strong**
- Why: Multiple high/medium-confidence CMOs across different chapters converge on enforceability-lite regimes, banking/crediting complexity, and evaluation ambiguity as recurring design-sensitive drivers of compliance and transparency risk.

- "such purchases could be banked as offset credit." [@martinIntroductionOverview1996]
- "requirements for proof of causality" [@redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- "Lack of clarity as to what is to be achieved by their use is a key problem in evaluation exercises." [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]

:::

## Procurement Performance

- **Outcome family description**: Cost/price premia, delays, administrative burden, restricted options, and other value-for-money/efficiency impacts.
- **Pathway**: Mandatory and/or high local-content designs can increase cost/delay risk (premia, administrative overhead, and slower procurement), particularly when obligations force inclusion of higher-cost domestic subcontractors; in contrast, designs that focus on *direct* offsets to safeguard a hazardous exchange are framed as more coherent for controlling procurement risk than diffuse indirect demands. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @al-ghrairSaudiArabiaOffsets1996; @taylorUsingProcurementOffsets2004; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Moderators**: Domestic capability/efficiency, the ability to price and contract for participation explicitly, and urgency of delivery shape whether “strict” participation rules translate into manageable premia or destabilizing performance risk. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @al-ghrairSaudiArabiaOffsets1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]
- **Counterclaims**: Some cost risk is endogenous to bargaining: suppliers may price expected obligations into the primary contract, making “offset costs” hard to separate from the negotiated package and sometimes reducing the appearance of direct penalties while preserving the economic incidence. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]
- **Design implications**: Treat performance risk as a design trade-off: set feasible obligations; prefer direct, program-linked work where the intent is collaboration depth tied to the procured system; and avoid rigid percentage escalation that forces low-productivity participation. [@taylorUsingProcurementOffsets2004; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Strength of evidence**: Moderate.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **moderate**
- Why: Multiple sources converge on (i) cost pass-through/premia and (ii) administrative/delivery delays as design-sensitive risks, though the corpus includes both conceptual and case-based statements and does not always quantify net incidence. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @al-ghrairSaudiArabiaOffsets1996; @taylorUsingProcurementOffsets2004]

- "substantial premiums will need to be paid to attract high-cost (less efficient) domestic subcontractors" [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]
- "administratively costly offsets obligations" [@markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996]
- "the offset requirement has slowed the already laborious procurement process" [@al-ghrairSaudiArabiaOffsets1996]
- "if government uses the instrument largely to safeguard an exchange in a hazardous setting, the direct offset is preferable" [@taylorUsingProcurementOffsets2004]
- "High offset demands will inevitably increase the costs" [@redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]

:::

## Partnerships and Supply Chains

- **Outcome family description**: Joint ventures, co-production/co-development, supplier-network integration, and durable industrial linkages.
- **Pathway**: Design choices appear to shape collaboration depth by determining whether obligations create *new inter-firm relationships* (deeper embedding) versus allowing fulfillment through intra-firm transfers or pre-existing business; indirect and permissive fulfillment rules can satisfy obligations without materially deepening supply-chain collaboration. [@udisUSSwissF51996; @martinConcludingRemarks1996]
- **Moderators**: Where policy is oriented toward joint development/production with tasks defined in advance, collaboration can be structured more deeply than in generic offset-credit approaches that prioritize “clearing” obligations. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996]
- **Counterclaims**: Even shallow-looking fulfillment can still deliver near-term procurement/political objectives, implying that “depth” is not always the primary success metric for policymakers. [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Design implications**: If durable partnerships are the target, designs should bias toward direct, program-linked work packages and guard against “paper” fulfillment through permissive intra-corporate or pre-existing-relationship crediting. [@udisUSSwissF51996; @martinConcludingRemarks1996]
- **Strength of evidence**: Limited.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **limited**
- Why: Relatively few RQ3-coded CMOs are mapped to this family; they are high-confidence but provide narrower coverage of how design choices affect supply-chain embedding versus shallow fulfillment. [@udisUSSwissF51996; @martinConcludingRemarks1996; @martinIntroductionOverview1996]

- "merely reflected existing business relations." [@martinConcludingRemarks1996]
- "joint development and production allows the tasks that Spanish industry will undertake to be defined in advance" [@martinIntroductionOverview1996]

:::

## Technology Transfer and Learning

- **Outcome family description**: Transfer depth/quality, licensing/know-how, skills, absorptive capacity, and learning-by-doing (including constraints on transfer).
- **Pathway**: Direct vs. indirect designs appear to sort “learning depth”: direct, program-linked technology-transfer obligations can be structured to build competence, but weak additionality rules, credit inflation (multipliers), and permissive indirect fulfillment enable nominal compliance without commensurate learning; moreover, weak enforcement and supplier risk-management (e.g., older/limited-scope technology) constrain realized transfer. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @fergussonSearchStrategyEvolution1996; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @antonakisOffsetBenefitsGreek1996; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Moderators**: Absorptive capacity (skills, institutions, complementary industrial base) conditions whether transferred knowledge “sticks”; when capacity is weak, the same design can produce shallow transfer or short-lived assembly rather than durable learning. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]
- **Counterclaims**: Where policy designs deliberately avoid direct offsets (emphasizing indirect offsets or broader investment), they may pursue objectives other than deep defense-technology learning, trading depth for political feasibility or easier compliance. [@redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Design implications**: For deeper learning with lower risk of “illusory” transfer, designs should tighten additionality and proof-of-causality, constrain multipliers/crediting inflation, and align obligations with realistic absorption pathways. [@fergussonSearchStrategyEvolution1996; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Strength of evidence**: Moderate.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **moderate**
- Why: Multiple high/medium-confidence CMOs converge on additionality/crediting problems and absorption constraints as key moderators of technology-transfer depth; however, findings span conceptual arguments and case-based observations with uneven measurement of net learning. [@fergussonSearchStrategyEvolution1996; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]

:::

## Industrial Capability and Base

- **Outcome family description**: Defense-industrial capacity, self-reliance, sector growth/decline, and shifts in the domestic defense-industrial base.
- **Pathway**: Design choices that push for mandatory participation/local production can (in principle) “compensate” or sustain a domestic base, but they also elevate cost/feasibility risk when local assembly/production is expensive or when work is short-run and not tied to durable capability development; outcomes are sensitive to whether the design encourages lasting capacity versus temporary work placement. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @molas-gallartOffsetsIndustrialCooperation1996]
- **Moderators**: Domestic scale, cost competitiveness, and the degree to which designs define longer-term upgrading/learning pathways (rather than one-off assembly) condition whether “industrial base” effects persist. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]
- **Counterclaims**: Even when local assembly is ruled out on cost grounds, policy can shift toward alternative cooperation designs (e.g., more targeted industrial cooperation) that pursue capability objectives with lower performance risk than maximalist local production. [@molas-gallartOffsetsIndustrialCooperation1996]
- **Design implications**: For depth with lower risk, bias toward capability-relevant, sustained work packages and avoid mandatory local production targets that exceed competitive capacity; treat “industrial base compensation” claims as contingent on durability of the created work/learning. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @molas-gallartOffsetsIndustrialCooperation1996]
- **Strength of evidence**: Moderate.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **moderate**
- Why: Multiple CMOs describe both the intended “industrial base” logic and recurring feasibility/temporariness problems; the evidence base is broad but includes mixed measurement of persistence versus short-run activity. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]

**Relevant quotes**
- "Direct and indirect offsets offered the opportunity to buy the aircraft required and at the same time to compensate the defence industrial base" [@martinIntroductionOverview1996]
- "Although local assembly was finally ruled out because of the excessive expense involved" [@molas-gallartOffsetsIndustrialCooperation1996]
- "as soon as they were completed, the assembly line and the factory were closed" [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]

## Trade Finance and Market Effects

- **Outcome family description**: Exports/countertrade, trade balance/FX/financing constraints, market access/competitiveness, and related market-position effects.
- **Pathway**: Indirect/countertrade-focused designs can be used to address trade-balance and financing constraints and to win competitions via packaged finance/counterpurchase commitments; this can increase deal feasibility but often emphasizes financial clearing over deep industrial collaboration, changing the risk profile toward valuation/verifiability and away from capability-relevant embedding. [@martinCounterTradeOffsets1996; @06offsetsandfrencharmsexports]
- **Moderators**: When policy shifts away from maximalist percentage goals, it may reflect recognition of feasibility and incidence constraints in countertrade/offset clearing, implying that design tightening or relaxation is partly a response to implementation risk. [@fergussonSearchStrategyEvolution1996]
- **Counterclaims**: Some mandatory additionality logic aims to ensure reciprocal trade is “new activity,” suggesting that well-designed rules could, in principle, reduce the risk that countertrade simply re-labels existing trade. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]
- **Design implications**: If the aim is collaboration depth, indirect finance/countertrade designs should be treated as complements (or separate tracks) rather than proxies for sustained industrial partnership; if used, additionality and transparency rules become central to managing evaluability risk. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @martinCounterTradeOffsets1996; @06offsetsandfrencharmsexports]
- **Strength of evidence**: Moderate.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **moderate**
- Why: Several CMOs directly describe finance/countertrade as decisive in deal-making and as linked to trade-balance/financing logic; the collaboration-depth implications are more inferential and depend on how “offset value” is defined and audited.

- "rejection of the previous goal of seeking 100% offsets" [@fergussonSearchStrategyEvolution1996]

:::

## Domestic Economic Benefits

- **Outcome family description**: Jobs, investment, regional development, and other economic/development effects (including opportunity-cost framing).
- **Pathway**: Mandatory/visible offset promises can increase political acceptability of defence purchases by foregrounding jobs and macro-economic benefits, but designs that prioritize easy-to-claim (often indirect) economic activity can amplify additionality/verification risk and may trade off procurement performance or capability priorities; banking/credit mechanisms further shift designs toward intertemporal clearing and away from transparent, case-specific evaluation. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996; @struysOffsetsWeaponsProcurement1996; @dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996]
- **Moderators**: Domestic unemployment pressure and political contestation increase the attractiveness of designs that “show” domestic benefits; however, high administrative complexity and weak evaluation capacity make overstated benefit claims more likely to persist. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]
- **Counterclaims**: Where the macro objective is explicit (cyclical advantage) rather than collaboration depth, indirect designs may be judged “successful” on their own terms even if they do not deepen defence-industrial partnership. [@struysOffsetsWeaponsProcurement1996]
- **Design implications**: To reduce risk of overstatement and displacement, designs should separate (and transparently report) economic-aim instruments from capability-aim instruments, and tighten additionality/audit rules where domestic-benefit claims are used as justification. [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996]
- **Strength of evidence**: Moderate.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **moderate**
- Why: Multiple CMOs across chapters explicitly link offsets to political acceptability and macro goals and highlight design features (banking/crediting, rhetoric) that increase verification risk; the net benefit direction is more contested and context-dependent. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996; @struysOffsetsWeaponsProcurement1996; @dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]

**Relevant quotes**
- "As defence budgets have been cut and unemployment has risen, purchasers have sought a less costly form of procurement." [@martinIntroductionOverview1996]
- "the main goal is the achievement of important cyclical macro-economic advantages" [@struysOffsetsWeaponsProcurement1996]
- "offsets will give them political cover for what amounts to providing hidden subsidies to indigenous military industrial firms" [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify]
- "hyperbole of politicians seeking to persuade skeptical public opinion" [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]
- "Credits could then be used to discharge existing or future offsets obligations" [@markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996]

:::

## Procurement Politics and Decision

- **Outcome family description**: Deal approval dynamics, supplier selection, political acceptance/legitimation, and procurement likelihood (distinct from cost/schedule performance).
- **Pathway**: Offsets operate as a design-sensitive political instrument: mandatory or expected offset packages can build coalitions for procurement and differentiate otherwise similar offers, but they also create risks of “offset competition” escalation and of procurement decisions being swayed by promised (and hard-to-verify) side deals rather than core capability/performance. [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]
- **Moderators**: Where transparency/enforcement is weak, the persuasive function of offset promises can dominate because verification is difficult; conversely, clearer rules about how offsets may (or may not) influence selection can constrain politicized decision dynamics. [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]
- **Counterclaims**: Some evidence frames offsets as a legitimate differentiator when core offers are comparable, suggesting the political-decision pathway is not necessarily dysfunctional if bounded and transparent. [@redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **Design implications**: If the aim is to reduce decision risk while preserving legitimate industrial goals, designs should (i) define when offsets can influence selection; (ii) increase transparency of offset valuation; and (iii) resist escalation dynamics that raise downstream cost/compliance risks. [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996; @markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004]
- **Strength of evidence**: Moderate.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **moderate**
- Why: Multiple sources converge on offsets’ role in persuasion/selection dynamics and on escalation/competition tendencies; however, the corpus includes normative disagreement on whether this influence should be permitted and under what constraints.

- "cost offsets are a marketing tool, a way of building enthusiasm for or overcoming resistance" [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify]
- "Offsets offer companies a way to compete beyond the products themselves." [@redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- "spiralling offset competition" [@redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- "offsets should only influence which particular supplier to choose." [@dumasOffsetsMitigateMagnify]

:::

## Alliance Security Outcomes

- **Outcome family description**: Interoperability, standardization, readiness/sustainment, security of supply, deterrence, and other alliance/security effects.
- **Pathway**: Policy design choices shape “risk profiles” by influencing security externalities: technology-transfer/licensed-production designs can multiply leakage/diversion opportunities (raising proliferation/security risk), while weak multilateral constraints and limited integration of security evaluation into economic decision-making can leave these risks under-managed. [@markusenArmsTradeIlliberal]
- **Moderators**: The feasibility of alliance-wide constraints is limited where members have divergent dependence on offsets and differing willingness to accept constraints, weakening the enforceability of transparency/enforcement designs at the alliance level. [@udisUSOffsetPolicy1996]
- **Counterclaims**: Some designs focus on institutional coordination (codes of conduct) to reduce offset-related distortions, but evidence suggests limited impact when commitments are weak or politically constrained. [@udisUSOffsetPolicy1996]
- **Design implications**: If offset-linked collaboration is pursued, risk mitigation levers include stronger security-evaluation integration, tighter controls over sensitive technology transfer, and more enforceable multilateral commitments—recognizing that political feasibility is itself a binding constraint. [@markusenArmsTradeIlliberal; @udisUSOffsetPolicy1996]
- **Strength of evidence**: Limited.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Detail"}

**Strength of evidence**
- Rating: **limited**
- Why: Few RQ3-coded CMOs map to this family; they are conceptually coherent on leakage/proliferation and on limits of alliance constraint-setting, but do not provide broad comparative measurement across many cases. [@markusenArmsTradeIlliberal; @udisUSOffsetPolicy1996]

- "without integration of security evaluations and economic imperatives" [@markusenArmsTradeIlliberal]
- "the Code of Conduct will achieve little" [@udisUSOffsetPolicy1996]

## Other / Unclear

- **Outcome family description**: Use only when none of the above fit; explain what is unclear.
- **Pathway**: In contexts where a domestic product alternative exists, an “import with offset” can be seen as displacing domestic work rather than adding to it; this outcome does not cleanly separate into performance, industrial-base, or political-decision categories in the current mapping. [@martinUKExperienceOffsets1996]
- **Moderators**: The presence of a credible domestic option (and the domestic political economy around it) appears to condition whether offsets are perceived as additive collaboration or as displacement. [@martinUKExperienceOffsets1996]
- **Counterclaims**: Where domestic alternatives are weak or absent, offsets may be framed as comparatively more additive (even if imperfectly delivered), shifting the political-economy interpretation. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996]
- **Design implications**: Design evaluation should include a displacement counterfactual (domestic option vs import-with-offset) rather than treating offset credit as automatically additive. [@martinUKExperienceOffsets1996]

# Cross-Family Synthesis

### Key Enabling Contexts (Repeated)

- **High buyer leverage with credible enforcement**: Where buyers can credibly enforce obligations (contractual remedies or strong repeat-business leverage) and specify what counts, designs are more likely to shift from “promised” to auditable delivery, reducing compliance risk and making deeper collaboration more feasible. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996]
- **Policy specificity (direct, program-linked obligations)**: Designs framed as direct and tied to safeguarding a hazardous exchange are repeatedly treated as more coherent for managing risk and targeting collaboration depth than diffuse, indirect “percentage chasing.” [@taylorUsingProcurementOffsets2004; @redlichBusinessOffsetPractitioners1996]
- **High absorptive capacity**: Even with ambitious technology-transfer designs, depth depends on institutions/skills to absorb and sustain learning; without this, designs tend toward short-run assembly and shallow transfer. [@matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004]

### Main Boundary Conditions / Failure Points

- **Weak transparency/enforcement with complex credit rules**: Banking, multipliers, and vague additionality definitions increase the risk of inflated/illusory benefits and reduce evaluability, even when headline compliance appears high. [@martinIntroductionOverview1996; @matthewsDefenseOffsetsPolicy2004; @markowskiDefenceOffsetsPolicy1996]
- **Mandatory local content beyond competitive capacity**: High local content targets can require high-cost subcontractors and create premia/delays, raising procurement-performance risk and encouraging renegotiation or non-fulfilment. [@markowskiMandatoryDefenseOffsetsconceptual2004; @al-ghrairSaudiArabiaOffsets1996]
- **Security externalities and leakage risk**: Technology-sharing designs can increase proliferation/leakage risk when security evaluation is not integrated and when multilateral constraints are weak or unenforceable. [@markusenArmsTradeIlliberal; @udisUSOffsetPolicy1996]

### Implications for RQ3 (Conditional)

Across the RQ3-coded corpus, policy design choices shape collaboration depth and risk profiles primarily by allocating (i) what must be delivered (direct vs indirect; specified vs diffuse), (ii) how delivery is verified (transparency/audit design), and (iii) what happens when delivery fails (enforcement). Designs that are direct, specified, and enforceable tend to be associated with deeper, more auditable collaboration pathways but also require higher governance capacity; permissive, indirect, and enforcement-lite designs reduce immediate contracting friction but elevate non-fulfilment, additionality, and evaluation risk and often deliver shallower collaboration.
