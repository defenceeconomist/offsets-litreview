title: What is a Prisma Diagram
---

A PRISMA diagram is a flow diagram used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses to show how studies were identified, screened, and selected for inclusion.

It comes from the [PRISMA Statement](https://www.prisma-statement.org/) (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and is mainly about transparency — letting readers see exactly what happened to all the studies you found.

**What the diagram shows (step by step)**

Typically, a PRISMA diagram tracks studies through four stages:

1. **Identification**

   * Records found through database searches
   * Records found through other sources (e.g. references, grey literature)

2. **Screening**

   * Records after duplicates removed
   * Records screened by title and abstract
   * Records excluded at this stage

3. **Eligibility**

   * Full-text articles assessed
   * Full-text articles excluded (with reasons)

4. **Included**

   * Studies included in the qualitative synthesis
   * Studies included in the quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis), if applicable

**Why it matters**

* Makes the review **reproducible**
* Shows **potential bias** or subjectivity in study selection
* Required or strongly encouraged by most **academic journals**
* Helps readers quickly judge the **rigour** of the review
