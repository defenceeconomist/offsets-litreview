# OFFSETS Literature Review

A realist evidence synthesis and comparative case mapping of defence offsets/industrial participation policies, with a focus on alliance-relevant outcomes (e.g., interoperability, readiness, security of supply) and the conditions under which offsets help or hinder strategic partnerships.

## Aims

- Explain how offset and industrial participation policies interact with NATO-aligned defence priorities.
- Identify mechanisms and conditions that lead to durable industrial collaboration with allies and partners.
- Surface recurring risks (e.g., cost inflation, governance/opacity, corruption, export-control friction) and mitigation approaches.
- Map comparative country cases that demonstrate positive, negative, or mixed outcomes under different offset regimes.

## Research Questions

1. Under what contexts do offsets/industrial participation mechanisms enable alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability, readiness, security of supply, partnership durability)?
2. Which mechanisms systematically hinder those outcomes, and through what governance or market conditions?
3. How do policy design choices (mandatory vs. voluntary, direct vs. indirect, transparency/enforcement) shape collaboration depth and risk profiles across cases?
4. How can each pathway be summarized with enabling/limiting conditions and alliance-relevant outcomes?
5. What recurrent pathways can be mapped across countries to explain positive, negative, or mixed outcomes?

## Method

- **Realist evidence synthesis (CMO):** Extracts Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations from sources, then clusters mechanism tags into a small set of pathways (themes) to explain what works, for whom, and under what conditions; thematic summaries link pathways to alliance-relevant outcomes and enabling or constraining contexts.
- **Comparative case mapping:** Uses a consistent rubric to compare countries and programmes on policy design, depth of collaboration, alliance integration markers, and documented risks (prompt: `prompts/comparative_case_mapping_prompt.md`).
- **Two-lane search strategy:** Parallel searches for (1) offsets/industrial participation literature and (2) alliance-relevant industrial cooperation/interoperability literature to avoid terminology gaps.
- **Evidence mix:** Academic literature plus targeted grey literature (government policy, audits, NATO/EU material, and governance analyses).

In practice, the realist synthesis proceeds by extracting discrete CMO statements from each source, tagging contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes, and then grouping mechanisms into a small number of thematic pathways. Those pathways are summarized against alliance-relevant outcomes (interoperability, readiness, security of supply, partnership durability) and the contextual conditions that enable or constrain them. The mechanism map provides a traceable bridge from individual CMO records to thematic findings.

An iterative realist synthesis process combining inductive mechanism discovery, constant-comparative theme refinement, and theory consolidation prior to context–mechanism–outcome pattern building/

If you have, say, 180 mechanisms:

Start with 25 → generate initial themes

Next 25 → iterative classification

Repeat

Every ~75 mechanisms → run a merge/split audit

       │
       │  • Identify “how/why” causal explanations
       │  • Write short mechanism statements
       │  • Assign stable IDs (MECH_001, MECH_002…)

Stage 1 — Initial Theme Discovery (AI-assisted)
       │
       │  Input: First batch (≈20–30 mechanisms)
       │  Task: Group by shared generative process
       │  Output: Proto-mechanism themes (PM1, PM2…)

Stage 2 — Iterative Constant Comparison (AI-assisted, repeated)
       │
       │  For each new batch (≈15–25 mechanisms):
       │   • Compare to existing themes
       │   • Assign to existing theme OR
       │   • Create new theme OR
       │   • Mark ambiguous

Stage 3 — Theme Quality Control (AI-assisted audit)
       │
       │  • Merge themes that describe same process
       │  • Split themes containing multiple mechanisms
       │  • Remove vague or non-mechanism themes

Stage 4 — Mechanism Saturation Check (Human judgement)
       │
       │  Ask:
       │  • Do new mechanisms mostly fit existing themes?
       │  • Are new themes rare and substantively distinct?

Stage 5 — Link Mechanisms to Contexts (Next synthesis phase)
       │
       │  Identify patterns:
       │  “In context X, mechanism Y tends to fire”
       ▼
Stage 6 — Link Mechanisms to Outcomes
       │
       │  Identify outcome tendencies:
       │  “When Y fires, outcome Z is more/less likely”

Stage 7 — Build CMO Demi-Regularities
       │
       │  Context + Mechanism → Outcome patterns
       ▼
Stage 8 — Develop Explanatory Propositions
       │
       │  Middle-range theory statements, e.g.:
       │  “Where domestic absorptive capacity is high,
       │   learning-by-doing mechanisms generate
       │   sustained industrial capability.”
