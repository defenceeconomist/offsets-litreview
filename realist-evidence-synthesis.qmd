# Introduction

Defence offsets – compensation agreements linked to arms procurement – have become a standard feature of international defence trade. In a typical offset arrangement, the buyer government requires the foreign supplier to direct a portion of the contract value back into the buyer’s economy, through investments, technology transfers, or purchases [@TransparencyInternational2010Offsets]. Such practices are widespread have been known to exceed 100% of the main contract’s value [@Markowski_2014]. Proponents tout offsets as “win–win” deals that foster industrial development and technology gains for buyers while helping sellers secure contracts. Critics counter that the reality seldom matches the rhetoric, citing inefficiencies, inflated costs, and corruption risks [@TransparencyInternational2010Offsets]. This realist literature review examines the impact of defence offsets by synthesizing evidence from diverse case studies through the lens of context–mechanism–outcome (CMO) configurations. We explore __contexts__ (geographic, economic, political) in which offsets are implemented, analyse the __mechanisms__ they trigger (technology transfer, local industry development, etc.), and assess the __outcomes__ – intended and unintended – that result. Illustrative examples are drawn from Southeast Asia (e.g. Malaysia and Indonesia), Europe (including Switzerland and Visegrád Group countries), and beyond. Critical perspectives on corruption, policy design (such as offset multipliers), and absorptive capacity are integrated. The goal is to identify patterns of what works (or fails), for whom, and under what circumstances, thereby providing a nuanced understanding of defence offsets’ role in defence-industrial development.

# Methodology

This review adopts a realist synthesis approach, focusing on context–mechanism–outcome patterns across studies. Realist methodology acknowledges that the success or failure of policy interventions like offsets depends on specific contexts and underlying causal mechanisms. Rather than asking simply “Do offsets work?”, we ask: __how and why__ do offsets produce certain outcomes in particular settings. Relevant literature was gathered from academic sources (defence economics and security studies) and policy reports, including case studies provided (Malaysia, Indonesia, Central Eastern Europe, etc.) and credible analyses (e.g. Transparency International and industry reports). Each source was examined for details on the context (e.g. economic conditions, defence policy environment), the offset mechanisms employed (forms of industrial participation, technology sharing, contractual terms), and the outcomes observed (industrial growth, skill transfer, corruption incidents, strategic benefits or shortfalls). We then compared these CMO findings across cases to identify recurring configurations. By structuring the review with headings and concise paragraphs, we aim for clarity and readability. All evidence is cited, preserving the original references. This method allows a rigorous yet practically insightful assessment of defence offsets.

To support this literature review, GPT deep research (ChatGPT, July 2025 version) was used as a tool to assist in analysing a curated corpus of academic and policy literature on defence offsets. Initial insights, conceptual framing, and document selection were provided by the human analyst, who also directed the use of GPT’s document analysis functions to surface relevant themes, definitions, and empirical patterns. While GPT-assisted parsing helped accelerate the identification of content aligned with realist synthesis principles—such as context–mechanism–outcome (CMO) configurations—all resulting outputs were treated as drafts and were substantially edited, restructured, and supplemented through human analysis.

All GPT-generated material was carefully reviewed for accuracy, coherence, and relevance. The human analyst cross-checked interpretations against the original source documents and applied judgment to resolve ambiguities, exclude irrelevant content, and ensure methodological consistency. This approach maintained the rigour and contextual sensitivity required for realist synthesis, while benefiting from the efficiency and traceability of AI-assisted tools.

# Theoretical Framework

__Offsets in Theory – From Buyer’s Market to Strategic Tool:__ Traditional economic theory views defence offsets as a product of buyer’s market conditions. When arms suppliers outnumber buyers, purchasers can leverage offsets as a condition of sale – they demand offsets “because they can,” and vendors comply “because they must” . Historically, offsets expanded when post–Cold War defence budgets declined (the “peace dividend” era), intensifying competition among defence firms. Sellers, seeking economies of scale, offered technology transfers, local production, and investment projects to win contracts. These inducements became so prevalent that by 2021 offsets accounted for roughly half of global arms trade value. However, the global context shifted after 2022: surging demand (a “seller’s market” amid new security crises) reduced buyer leverage. Notably, recent research shows offsets persist even in this supply-driven market, as states prioritize long-term self-sufficiency and strategic partnerships. Anicetti (2025) finds that in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), urgent military needs post-Ukraine invasion did not fully sideline offsets; instead, buyers secured offset commitments by leveraging government-to-government deals and extended timelines for fulfilment. This challenges the notion that offsets are only artifacts of buyer dominance and suggests a broader strategic rationale [@Anicetti_2025]. 

__Mechanisms of Offsets:__ Offsets function through various mechanisms intended to build domestic capacity. A common mechanism is __technology transfer__, which may include licensed production of foreign weapons, local assembly lines, or training programs to impart know-how [@Maharani_2022]. For example, offsets often require the supplier to establish joint ventures with local industry or share design expertise for subsystems. __Industrial participation__ is another mechanism, wherein foreign contractors subcontract work to local firms or invest in new production facilities. These direct offsets aim to jump-start indigenous defence manufacturing or related high-tech sectors. __Indirect offsets__ channel investment into broader economic projects (civilian manufacturing, infrastructure, etc.) to spur general economic growth or trade balances. Some countries prioritise one type over the other based on goals: Poland, for instance, has emphasized general economic benefits (indirect offsets) to maximize overall impact, whereas South Korea prioritizes defence-industrial know-how via direct tech transfers to build its domestic defence industry [@Dehoff2014Offsets]. 

__Offsets as “Insurance” and National Security:__ A theoretical perspective by @Kanniainen_2017 conceptualizes offsets as an __insurance mechanism__ for national security. In their model, requiring an offset is like paying a premium within the contract price (indeed, the supplier often capitalizes the offset cost into a higher sale price) in exchange for reducing future risks. By securing local production capability or diversified supply chains through offsets, a state insures against supply disruptions or embargoes. This rationale is reflected in policy: for example, Indonesia’s defence law explicitly ties offsets to avoiding future arms embargoes – if foreign procurement is unavoidable, countertrade, local content and offsets “must prevail” to ensure sovereignty in using and sustaining the equipment [@Maharani_2022]. In theory, then, offsets contribute a form of security dividend beyond the weapon itself. 

__Policy Design and Absorptive Capacity:__ The literature stresses that context-specific policy design heavily influences offset outcomes [@Kirchwehm2014DefenceOffsets]. One-size-fits-all approaches are ineffective. Countries have adopted different rules on __offset percentages, multipliers, and eligible activities__ to align offsets with national priorities. __Offset multipliers__ – giving extra credit (e.g. 2x or 3x value) for certain high-priority activities – are a common design feature. India’s offset policy, for instance, assigns up to 300% credit for investments that enable unrestricted domestic production and export of advanced technology [@Dehoff2014Offsets]. This incentivizes contractors to propose more ambitious technology projects, knowing they will more quickly fulfil offset obligations. Switzerland’s updated 2021 offset policy likewise introduced multipliers up to 3× when an offset project’s national security benefit exceeds its cost [@Janes2021]. Another design variable is the threshold value for offsets – e.g. Switzerland now imposes offsets only on contracts above CHF 20 million [@Janes2021], focusing on significant deals. 

Crucially, the notion of absorptive capacity emerges as a determining context in offset success. Absorptive capacity refers to the recipient country’s existing industrial base, skills, and institutions to absorb and utilize the incoming technology or investments. If a defence contractor offers sophisticated co-production, but the local workforce and firms lack the requisite skills or infrastructure, the offset may underperform or fail. Indeed, best practices for contractors include assessing “what capabilities and infrastructure the customer has in place” to fulfil offset projects [@Dehoff2014Offsets]. A thorough review of the buyer’s __manufacturing base, labour force, and R&D capacity__ is advised before finalizing an offset proposal. High-profile offset programs have faltered when absorptive capacity was overestimated: short-term assembly work often ceases once the vendor’s obligations are met, if the local economy cannot sustain production independently [@Kirchwehm2014DefenceOffsets]. Thus, a realist framework expects that contexts with strong human capital, prior industrial expertise, and good governance will translate offset mechanisms into positive outcomes more effectively than contexts lacking those attributes. 

__Offsets, Efficiency, and Corruption Risks:__ Economic analyses are ambivalent about offsets’ net benefits. Offsets undeniably add complexity and often cost to arms deals – one estimate notes that offset arrangements inflate contract prices, and these costs “are borne by the importing country” (the buyer) in the end [@TransparencyInternational2010Offsets]. From a market efficiency standpoint, mandated offsets can lead to suboptimal allocation of resources: they may force purchases from higher-cost local suppliers or create industries that are not globally competitive, solely to satisfy offset credits. @Markowski_2014 question whether mandated offsets can ever fully deliver on their promises, given these inherent inefficiencies and the administrative burden of managing them. Beyond economics, __corruption risk__ is a persistent concern. Transparency International flags defence offsets as highly susceptible to corruption due to their complexity and lack of scrutiny [@TransparencyInternational2010Offsets]. Offset negotiations often occur in the shadow of the main contract, with far less transparency and oversight [@TransparencyInternational2010Offsets]. This opacity can enable several corruption mechanisms: officials might favour an unnecessary arms purchase because of enticing offset deals (improperly influencing procurement needs), or they might skew contract awards toward a supplier who offers lucrative side-contracts to domestic entities (influencing vendor selection), and offset projects themselves can be vehicles to channel kickbacks to insiders under the guise of subcontracts or investments. Numerous defence bribery scandals have involved offsets – either as the incentive or the payoff. Therefore, any theoretical benefits of offsets must be weighed against these practical risks. Strong governance, transparency requirements, and monitoring are often recommended as safeguards (e.g., TI urges that “performance delivery and transparency” be made cornerstones of offset policy [@TransparencyInternational2010Offsets]). 

In summary, the theoretical landscape treats offsets as a double-edged sword: a potential catalyst for defence-industrial development and strategic autonomy, but one fraught with economic inefficiency and corruption peril if mismanaged. The following case studies will illustrate these dynamics in concrete national contexts, highlighting how varying conditions and implementation approaches yield very different outcomes.

# Case Study Synthesis by Region and Theme

## Southeast Asia: Malaysia’s and Indonesia’s Offset Journeys

__Malaysia – High Hopes and Mixed Outcomes:__ Malaysia embraced defence offsets in the 1990s as a key instrument for defence-industrialisation. Big-ticket arms purchases – from British, Russian, American, French, and other suppliers – were all tied to offset requirements aimed at technology transfer and local industry involvement. Notably, even before a formal policy existed, Malaysia pursued ad hoc offsets on major deals, seeking a “third-way” to industrial development beyond classic import-substitution or export-promotion. The context was an emerging economy with aspirations (articulated in Vision 2020) to leap into high-tech sectors like aerospace. Offsets were implicitly seen as a catalyst for this technological transformation [@Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets]. 

Mechanisms in Malaysia’s case centred on __direct offsets__: foreign vendors were obligated to invest in Malaysian defence-related projects or partner with local firms. Because no unified policy existed until 2005, implementation was uneven – the nature and quality of offset projects depended largely on the “skills and experience of individual project teams” and the negotiating clout of the government at the time. In 1999 the Finance Ministry issued guidelines (e.g. defining thresholds and priority areas) to formalize the process, and by 2005 an official offset policy came into force. The __mechanisms__ deployed included local license production/assembly of aircraft parts, maintenance and overhaul facilities, training programs, and some technology collaborations in aerospace and electronics. An illustrative outcome was the growth of Malaysia’s aerospace composites sector: offset arrangements led to local companies gaining specialized skills in composite manufacturing and integration, plugging into global supply chains for major aviation programs. This is cited as a success – offsets facilitated specialization, competitiveness and high value-added operations in Malaysia’s aerospace industry, with local firms becoming suppliers and partners at the global level [@Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets]. 

However, the __outcomes__ overall were __mixed and leaning toward disappointment__. After nearly two decades of offset experience, Malaysia had not achieved its overarching goal of defence-industrial self-reliance; the country still lacked the ability to design and produce complex weaponry independently. A detailed assessment by Balakrishnan and Matthews [-@Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets] finds that while offsets “exerted a positive impact on the local industrial landscape”, the progress was modest and fragmented. By the mid-2000s, about 60% of Malaysia’s offset projects had been directed towards training and through-life support (maintenance, spare parts) rather than actual R&D or high-end manufacturing. This focus yielded some skilled personnel but negligible local R&D capacity and very limited job creation – “woeful” in the authors’ words. There was impressive industrial diversification, yet much of it was in commercial (civil sector) activities spun off from defence deals. In other words, offsets sometimes helped Malaysian firms pivot to profitable civilian markets (a serendipitous benefit), but did not strongly anchor a self-sustaining defence production base. On balance, Malaysia’s offset experience is judged “disappointing, with the costs seemingly outweighing the benefits”. The disappointing progress – decades of offsets and still a “distant goal” of self-reliance – prompted Malaysia to tighten its policy framework in 2005 and beyond. It was hoped that clearer guidelines, higher local content targets, and better project selection could improve outcomes. It may be too early to fully judge the post-2005 era, but the lesson from the 1990s–2000s was clear: without a coherent strategy and strong absorptive capacity, offsets did not automatically translate into the advanced defence-industrial capabilities Malaysia sought. 

__Indonesia – Offsets for Strategic Autonomy:__ Indonesia provides a more recent example of an emerging economy attempting to leverage offsets for strategic and economic ends. With a large population and modest industrial base, Indonesia long imported major weapon systems. A turning point came with a 2012 defence industry law that encapsulated a political resolve to never again be crippled by foreign embargoes (Indonesia had experienced U.S. arms embargoes in the past). The law mandated that _if foreign procurement is inevitable, it must include countertrade, local content, and offsets to the fullest extent_. This led to the implementation of a comprehensive offset policy from 2014, under Government Regulation No. 76/2014, later refined by a 2015 Ministerial Regulation [@Maharani_2022]. Indonesia’s __offset mechanism__ is notably stringent and prescriptive: __no minimum contract threshold__ (even relatively small deals require offsets), __35% minimum offset/local content__ on any defence contract value (combined with countertrade, total local contribution must reach at least 85%) with a planned 10% increase every five years. The policy also introduced __multipliers (1x to 3x)__, with the highest multipliers given to activities linked to seven strategic technology areas (jet fighters, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets, radars, propellants) that Indonesia prioritizes for indigenous development. Additionally, penalties of up to 5% of contract value can be imposed for non-fulfilment, signalling serious intent [@Maharani_2022]. 

The initial rollout of this aggressive policy was challenging. Foreign suppliers were confused and reluctant in the face of Indonesia’s new rules, which initially lacked clarity in terms of contractual requirements, monitoring, and penalties. Negotiations stalled on several programs when vendors hesitated to commit to Indonesia’s demands [@Maharani_2022]. It wasn’t until 2015 – after the creation of an ad-hoc Offset Team to issue detailed guidelines – that implementation gained momentum. From 2015 to 2019, Indonesia saw a surge of offset activity: 31 offset programs were initiated in this period. Two smaller projects were completed (military bridges and trainer aircraft), 25 projects were in execution (including a degaussing system and a Sukhoi fighter simulator), and others were in negotiation. A landmark case was the 2018 contract for 11 Russian Su-35 fighters (~US$1.1 billion): Indonesia structured it such that about 50% of the payment value was in commodities (countertrade, e.g. palm oil) and 35.3% of the contract value entailed offsets. In effect, Indonesia leveraged its natural resources as partial payment while insisting on technology and local involvement as well – a creative approach to meet financial and industrial goals simultaneously [@Maharani_2022]. 

The __outcomes__ in Indonesia are still unfolding, but early indications show some tangible benefits. By 2019, the offset projects had generated an estimated __US$3.1__ billion in investments, equivalent to 75% of the combined value of the procurement programs launched in that period [@Maharani_2022]. This suggests that Indonesia was largely successful in enforcing its offset percentage targets. More importantly, qualitative outcomes at state-owned defence firms hint at progress in capability. For instance, PT Pindad (Indonesia’s primary land systems company) went through phased capacity-building via offsets: in the first stage of partnerships, it received training, technical assistance, and basic assembly know-how (but produced no exports or R&D). In a second stage, Pindad improved skills (training, assembly) and know-how (including work discipline and language skills for international collaboration). By a later stage, Pindad was engaging in manufacturing and integrating more complex subsystems (electronics and weapon integration) and even achieving small-scale supply chain creation and low-value exports. Although advanced R&D was still absent, this progression illustrates how sustained offsets can incrementally move a local industry up the value chain [@Maharani_2022]. 

Indonesia’s case underscores the importance of __political context__ and __institutional follow-through__. The driving motivation was clearly strategic autonomy – offsets are seen as a tool to ensure that Indonesia can maintain and operate its arsenal without overreliance on foreign suppliers or vulnerability to sanctions [@Maharani_2022]. The government demonstrated commitment by creating new bureaucratic mechanisms (the Offset Team, detailed regulations) and pushing both foreign suppliers and domestic stakeholders to comply. By 2017, suppliers had come to a “grudging acceptance” that robust offsets were a permanent feature of Indonesia’s defence market. This acceptance was aided by the government’s willingness to negotiate and adjust – e.g., clarifying rules and perhaps showing flexibility in how offset credit could be earned. Indonesia also cleverly tied offsets to broader economic policy, using countertrade (commodity exports) to offset costs and ensure deals were palatable to both sides. 

__Comparative insights (Malaysia & Indonesia):__ Both Malaysia and Indonesia illustrate the use of offsets in Southeast Asia to build defence-industrial capacity and broader economic benefits. Malaysia’s earlier, laissez-faire approach (with weak coordination and late policy formalization) resulted in more piecemeal outcomes, while Indonesia’s highly centralized and mandatory approach kick-started many projects in a short time. Yet, they also share challenges common to emerging economies: the __absorptive capacity constraint__ – e.g., Malaysia struggled to move beyond licensed assembly to true innovation (limited R&D absorption), and Indonesia still relies on foreign technology leadership in its offset projects. Both countries highlight that offsets are no panacea; they require strong policy guidance and realistic expectations. They also show some positive unintended outcomes: Malaysia channelled some defence offsets into successful civilian sectors (aerospace parts), and Indonesia leveraged offsets for diplomatic and economic ends (barter trade and defence ties with Russia and others). Notably, neither case has been tarnished by major corruption scandals in offsets (at least publicly), perhaps due to the relatively controlled nature of these programs by the state – though Malaysia’s offsets did suffer from opacity and lack of oversight in earlier years. Moving forward, these cases will be watched to see if initial gains (skills, partial local production) can evolve into sustained independent capabilities – or if they plateau once offset obligations are met.

## Central and Eastern Europe: Visegrád Group Experiences

The Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries provide a contrasting regional context: transitioning economies and new NATO members in the early 2000s, eager both to modernize militaries and to boost their economies after the Soviet era. Offsets were seen as a tool for economic revival at a time when foreign investment, job creation, and technology inflows were urgently needed [@Lazar_2019]. The Visegrád Group – Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia – each pursued offsets in their defence procurement, with varying degrees of success. 

__Poland – Offsets to Underwrite Modernization:__ Poland, the largest Visegrád country, made one of the region’s most ambitious offset deals when it decided to purchase 48 F-16 fighter jets from the United States in 2003. In that high-profile competition, the U.S. F-16 faced off against offers from European suppliers (such as the Dassault Mirage 2000 and Saab Gripen). Poland’s government evaluated bids not only on technical and cost merits but heavily on offset packages. In fact, the proposed __offsets sometimes carried equal or greater weight than price__ in these decisions. Lockheed Martin clinched the deal in no small part due to an unprecedented offset offer valued at over $9 billion – far exceeding the ~$3.5 billion cost of the jets themselves [@Dehoff2014Offsets]. This package comprised offset projects: 55 in the defence sector (e.g. co-production of aircraft components, local servicing facilities, cooperation with Polish defence firms) and 49 in the broader Polish economy [@Dehoff2014Offsets]. The projects spanned aerospace, electronics, automotive, and even commercial ventures, aiming to inject technology and capital across Poland’s industrial landscape. Contemporary reports cited Lockheed’s massive offset commitment as “a major reason” Poland chose the F-16 over competing aircraft. In essence, Poland leveraged its purchase to also buy a stimulus for its economy. 

The __outcome__ of Poland’s F-16 offset program was closely watched. In quantitative terms, the Ministry of Economy in later years reported high fulfilment rates by Lockheed and its partners – by one account, over 90% of the promised offset value was realized within a decade, creating thousands of jobs (at least temporarily) and boosting exports in some sectors. Qualitatively, some Polish companies gained new capabilities: for example, WSK Rzeszów (a Polish aerospace firm) received work share in engine production, and the Polish defence electronics industry benefited from joint projects. However, independent evaluations noted that __not all offsets created lasting value__. A portion of the “offset” consisted of one-off business contracts or simple purchases from Polish suppliers, which, while meeting the letter of obligations, did not always lead to sustained industrial growth. There were also delays and difficulties in implementing some high-technology projects. Overall, Poland’s strategy did achieve a short-term infusion of investment and know-how – it “provided the highest possible economic impact” as intended – but it is debatable how much of that translated into long-term competitiveness. Still, Poland stands out as a case where offsets were actively managed as a national program to advance both defence and civil industry goals, and where the government was willing to enforce penalties on underperforming offset projects (Poland had passed an “offset law” with penalty clauses [@AviationWeek2003PolandOffset]). This assertiveness might explain the relatively high completion rate of offset commitments there. 

__Czech Republic and Hungary – Gripen Deals and Controversy:__ The Czech Republic and Hungary, both NATO entrants in 1999, each needed to replace outdated Soviet-era fighter jets. In the early 2000s, they independently came to the decision to acquire the Swedish/British JAS-39 Gripen. Both governments entered lease-to-buy arrangements for 14 Gripen fighters each (Czech deal ~$750 million for a 10-year lease; Hungary ~$900 million) [CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021]. Offsets were integral to these deals: Saab and its partner BAE Systems offered sizable offset packages to sweeten the agreement. Publicly, these were framed as opportunities to invigorate local industries – much like in Poland, promises were made of investments, joint ventures, and manufacturing work in the Czech and Hungarian economies. 

However, the __mechanism behind the scenes__ appears to have also included illicit payments. Subsequent investigations and media exposés (led by Swedish and UK outlets) uncovered a __network of middlemen and alleged bribes__ used to secure the Gripen selection. An Austrian businessman working as BAE’s agent in Central Europe, Count Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly, was identified as a key figure who funnelled commissions to decision-makers [@CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021]. Documents later suggested that as much as SEK 735 million (≈ €80 million) was earmarked for paying off about 20 Czech politicians and officials, and another SEK 126 million for five Hungarian contacts. These alleged bribes correspond to the period when both countries were evaluating bids – notably, American competitors (Lockheed Martin and Boeing offering the F-16 and F-18) withdrew from the Czech tender, citing that the conditions were rigged in favour of the Gripen and that it was “impossible for them to compete” in such circumstances [@CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021]. This implies that beyond the above-board offsets, under-the-table incentives tilted the playing field. 

The __outcomes__ of the Czech and Hungarian Gripen offsets are therefore intertwined with corruption outcomes. On one hand, the two countries did receive the Gripen fighters which have been operational for their air forces (and both later extended their lease or purchase agreements, indicating satisfaction with the platform). On the economic side, some legitimate offset projects did take place. For example, in the Czech Republic, Saab/BAE fulfilled offset obligations by investing in Czech aerospace and automotive firms and by facilitating exports of Czech products. Reports claim the Czech offset program (valued at 130% of the Gripen contract) was completed successfully in terms of numbers, contributing to areas like aircraft maintenance capabilities and new factories for aviation components. Hungary similarly saw investments and partnerships (with an even larger offset requirement, purportedly 110% of contract). Yet, __these outcomes are clouded by the sense that they could have been larger or more effective were it not for governance issues__. An analysis by Zsolt Lazar [-@Lazar_2019] finds that the Gripen offset programs __fell short of delivering the transformative impact hoped for__. One reason was that both countries, especially Hungary, failed to maximize the benefits – possibly due to weaker institutional capacity to absorb and direct the offsets (a smaller industrial base than Poland, for instance) and possibly because corruption diverted focus from genuine industrial objectives. In Hungary’s case, there was little transparency on offset results; even a parliamentary inquiry in 2007 kept its findings classified and noted that key procurement documents had “disappeared,” hampering oversight [@CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021]. This suggests that not only was corruption a risk, it may have materially impaired the implementation and monitoring of the offset projects. In short, while some factories were built and some jobs created under the Gripen offsets, neither Czechia nor Hungary experienced a defence-industrial renaissance; the deals ultimately served to equip the air force with modern fighters (the primary goal) but the broader economic spin-offs were modest once the initial flurry of offset activities subsided. 

__Slovakia and others:__ Slovakia, the fourth Visegrád member, also engaged in offsets for some defence procurements (e.g. radar systems, armoured vehicles), but on a smaller scale as its acquisitions were more limited. More recently, as Slovakia opted in 2018 to buy U.S. F-16s, it negotiated industrial cooperation agreements rather than formal offsets, partly reflecting NATO standardization and lessons learned from neighbours. Other CEE countries outside Visegrád, like __Romania__ and __Bulgaria__, likewise pursued offsets in aircraft or naval purchases in the 2000s, often facing similar hurdles of limited absorptive capacity and occasionally controversy. Romania’s attempt to demand offsets for multi-role fighters was complicated by financial constraints and ultimately it bought second-hand F-16s with minimal offsets. __Overall, the CEE experience shows how pivotal context is__: these mid-sized economies saw offsets as a remedy for post-communist economic woes, but the success correlated with how robust and transparent their governance was. Poland, with stronger institutions and a larger industrial base, arguably extracted more value (in scale if not in efficiency) from offsets. Smaller states or those with governance deficits realized fewer lasting benefits – and, in the worst cases, offsets became entangled with patronage networks and corruption, as the Gripen case exemplifies.

## Western Europe and Advanced Economies: Offsets under Scrutiny

In Western Europe and other advanced economies, defence offsets have been practiced under a different context – one of generally mature industries and, more recently, regulatory pushback. Two focal points here are __Switzerland__, a neutral advanced economy that relies on foreign arms but wants to sustain a high-tech industry, and the __European Union’s__ efforts to curb offsets among its member states. 

__Switzerland – Maintaining Domestic Industry:__ Switzerland has a long-standing offset policy aimed at ensuring that when it buys major defence equipment from abroad, its own industry benefits in return. The context is a country with a capable but niche defence–industrial sector (e.g. precision manufacturing, optics, aerospace components) that cannot survive on domestic military orders alone. Thus, the government views offsets as a tool to keep Swiss defence firms engaged and technologically advanced, and to __“reduce...dependency on foreign countries” while strengthening national supply security__ [@SwissFedCouncil2021OffsetPolicy]. Traditionally, Switzerland required offset equal to 100% of the contract value for large purchases [@BIS2003SixthOffsetReport] – effectively a one-to-one reinvestment. These offsets could be direct (related to the defence item) or indirect (unrelated sectors), and Swiss firms across various domains (from metallurgy to electronics to services) have received business as a result [@Janes2021]. For example, when Switzerland procured F/A-18 Hornet fighters in the 1990s, offset deals included Swiss companies manufacturing parts of the aircraft and foreign contractors funding R&D at Swiss tech institutes. Similarly, recent programs (like the purchase of new air defence systems or consideration of new fighter jets) come with mandated offsets that foreign bidders must incorporate. 

The __mechanisms__ Switzerland employs have evolved. As of July 2021, Switzerland “tweaked” its offset policy with some nuanced changes. It introduced a threshold: only contracts above CHF 20 million incur offset obligations, so smaller deals won’t trigger the administrative burden of offsets. It also granted Armasuisse (the defence procurement agency) more flexibility to award multipliers up to 3× for high-value activities [@Janes2021]. This means if a foreign supplier engages in a project deemed exceptionally beneficial (say, transferring cutting-edge aerospace manufacturing to a Swiss plant), each franc invested might count triple towards their offset requirement – a clear incentive to propose top-tier technology collaborations. The updated policy clarifies eligible offset activities: co-production, licensed production, subcontracting to Swiss companies, technology and expertise transfer, project financing in Switzerland, and even marketing support for Swiss products are all creditable. Interestingly, the policy delineates a wide array of sectors, well beyond traditional defence manufacturing – including chemicals, electronics, vehicles, telecommunications, IT services, R&D, etc. This breadth shows Switzerland’s interest in maximizing offsets for general industrial and technological benefit, not just narrow defence needs. 

The __outcomes__ for Switzerland have generally been positive in the sense that offsets are credited with helping sustain high-skilled jobs and companies. Swiss industry associations often lobby for strong offsets to ensure they get a share of big contracts. For example, with the planned procurement of the F-35A Lightning II jets (a deal decided in 2021), Switzerland has stipulated a 60% offset (lower than 100% historically, possibly due to the EU pressure and the unique nature of the F-35 global supply chain). Even so, this means over CHF 4 billion of work should flow to Swiss firms, in areas like airframe components, engine parts, and software development, according to public statements. While some economists argue these requirements could increase the purchase price, Swiss policymakers contend that without offsets, domestic defence suppliers would atrophy and the country would lose sovereign capability in key technologies. __No major corruption issues__ have surfaced in Swiss offset practices – likely owing to Switzerland’s strong governance and the transparent, codified process managed by Armasuisse. One could critique the efficiency (would free-market competition allocate resources better than offset mandates?), but politically, offsets enjoy support as they justify to the public the large expenditures on foreign weapons by ensuring local economic return. In sum, Switzerland demonstrates an advanced economy using offsets more as an industrial policy tool (to keep its tech sector vibrant) than as a developmental crutch. The context of a small, highly-skilled economy shapes this usage: Switzerland doesn’t seek to build an entire indigenous defence industry from scratch (it will always buy fighter jets abroad), but through offsets it leverages foreign deals to invest in its comparative advantages (precision engineering, etc.). 

__European Union – Phasing Out Offsets?:__ Within the EU, defence offsets have long been seen by the European Commission as distortions of the single market. Defence trade in the EU historically fell under national security exemptions, allowing member states to impose offsets and favour local suppliers. However, in 2009 the EU adopted the __Defence Procurement Directive (2009/81/EC)__, aiming to introduce more competition and transparency in defence contracts across Europe. The Commission explicitly sought to reduce the use of __Article 346__ (the treaty clause allowing national security exemptions) that members used to justify offsets. The Directive and subsequent Commission guidance essentially declared that __offsets are protectionist and violate EU principles of non-discrimination__ . Unless an offset can be strictly justified as necessary for essential security interests (and directly related to the item procured), it should not be used. Indirect offsets, by definition unrelated to the purchased system, were deemed **incompatible with EU law and “in any case prohibited.”**. The Commission urged member states to instead use the new legal framework (e.g. allow some localization via subcontracting within competitive bidding, without explicit offset clauses). By making the rules of the game clearer, the Commission hoped to narrow the national security exemption and push states away from automatic offsets [@Weiss_2015]. 

The __impact__ of this EU policy shift was significant. Over the 2010s, most EU countries revised or scrapped their formal offset policies. By 2013, after transposition of the directive, the European defence market saw a __decline in offset arrangements__ – particularly indirect offsets essentially disappeared in EU deals, and direct offsets became rarer or smaller in scope. Matthews and Anicetti (2020) note that this “gradual demise of offset” in Europe aligns with a global trend among advanced countries moving away from offsets. Countries like the UK had already reduced offsets (the UK shifted to more flexible “industrial participation” approaches), and smaller EU members complied to avoid infringement procedures. The Commission did follow up: in 2016 it warned several states to halt offset practices or face legal action. Greece learned this the hard way in a case where the European Court of Justice struck down its attempt to require local production of submarine components as unjustified. Thus, within the EU, formal offset as a policy became largely delegitimized. 

However, there are nuances. The EU did allow certain exclusions – joint development programs (like the Eurofighter) and government-to-government sales can be exempt from the directive. Many countries have since framed industrial benefits not as “offset obligations” but as part of the package in G2G deals (which the directive doesn’t fully govern). For example, when Finland bought F-35s (a non-EU product via a U.S. FMS deal), it still arranged industrial participation for Finnish firms, describing it in terms of security of supply rather than offsets per se. Similarly, current large projects under EU auspices emphasize cooperative development instead of classical offsets. The net effect is that in Western Europe, the __culture around offsets changed__ – from being a routine sweetener to something done more subtly or justified in different terms. Advanced European defence suppliers (like France, Germany, Sweden) were somewhat supportive of reducing offsets, since they often had been on the hook to provide them; eliminating offsets could lower their costs and avoid “inefficient resource allocation and anti-competitive market behaviours” that offsets entailed. Indeed, as @Matthews_2020 put it, Europeans had for decades articulated offsets with “win-win” narratives that seldom matched reality, as many offset programs “failed to generate enduring high value investment and skilled employment” while often adding cost premiums to deals. By 2020, offset was increasingly seen as a phenomenon __“for developing countries”__, not something advanced integrated markets should do. 

That said, strategic and political realities sometimes reassert themselves. The Commission’s vision of a pure open market met pushback from some member states concerned about their defence industries. Countries like __Poland and offset-dependent economies in CEE__ were wary of losing out on local benefits. France and others insist on European preference in subtle ways. Moreover, after 2022 (with massive rearmament programs in Europe), even the Commission has softened stance on using defence procurement as a tool to bolster the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB). One could argue this is a return of “offset-like” thinking, but within Europe rather than nationally – encouraging contracts to stay in Europe (which in effect is like an intra-EU offset approach). Nonetheless, formally, the EU made offsets a dirty word and forced a realignment: countries like Italy, the Netherlands, Norway (the latter two are European but non-EU NATO members who followed similar logic) dropped their old offset mandates. 

In summary, advanced economies have trended toward minimizing traditional offsets, driven by both recognition of their flaws and by multilateral rules. Offsets in these contexts have shifted toward __“best value” procurement models__ that still allow industrial benefits but under stricter rules. The contrast with emerging economies is stark: while Indonesia mandates 35% local content, a country like __Australia__ outright abolished offsets in the 1990s as a policy decision, judging them counterproductive. The United States, as a seller, has never officially recognized offsets domestically (the U.S. does not demand offsets for its own imports and calls its domestic preferences “Buy American” rather than offsets). However, U.S. companies do engage in offsets abroad and the U.S. government monitors it. A 2017 U.S. report showed declining offset obligations for American exporters, indicating perhaps that even buyers were asking for less, or at least that deals were structured differently. Taken together, one can say context is key: in advanced economies with strong domestic industries, offsets are viewed as distortions to phase out, whereas in less developed economies, offsets remain an alluring policy to obtain foreign investment and tech.

# Discussion

__Context-Matter Matters – No One-Size-Fits-All:__ Across these cases, it becomes evident that offsets are not a monolithic tool; their efficacy depends greatly on context. As one study succinctly put it, an offsets strategy “should not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach”. Each country’s historical, economic, and industrial circumstances shape what offsets can achieve. For instance, Malaysia’s and Indonesia’s experiences underscore the importance of __institutional context__. Malaysia’s initially informal approach meant offsets were handled in an ad hoc manner, yielding ad hoc results. Once Malaysia instituted clearer policy and oversight (post-2005), there was at least a framework to target priorities (e.g. focus on aerospace tech, involve the Malaysian Industry-Government Group for High Technology, etc.) [@Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets]. Indonesia, learning from others, built a detailed policy from the outset, but then had to iterate on it to address gaps and get compliance. The degree of top-level political support and coordination strongly influenced outcomes: Indonesia’s high-level push ensured offsets were pursued even if that risked initial deal delays, whereas countries that treated offsets as secondary or purely transactional often saw them under-deliver [@Maharani_2022]. 

The __economic context__ (size and capability of the local industrial base) is perhaps the clearest determinant of offset outcomes. Countries with some existing industrial capacity and skilled workforce can absorb more advanced offset projects. Poland and the Czech Republic, inheriting a manufacturing base from the Cold War (even if outdated), could take on aerospace and automotive offset work more readily than a very low-tech economy could. Conversely, Saudi Arabia’s experience (not covered in detail above, but known in literature) shows a wealthy buyer with minimal local technical workforce can struggle – Saudi offset companies had to be kept afloat by government contracts and ended up employing expatriate labour, failing to create many skilled Saudi jobs [@Balakrishnan2009MalaysiaOffsets]. The __absorptive capacity__ concept recurs: offsets only foster enduring outcomes if the local context includes complementary investments in education, infrastructure, and governance. Where offset projects were aligned with local comparative advantages or existing clusters, they tended to last. For example, offset investments in Switzerland’s precision engineering succeeded because they built on a long tradition of Swiss quality manufacturing; in Brazil, Embraer’s aerospace prowess made it a good partner for technology-sharing offsets (as seen in examples of joint ventures with Israeli UAV firms) [@Dehoff2014Offsets]. In contrast, offsets that tried to create entirely new industries from scratch (e.g. high-tech electronics in a country without an electronics sector) often dissipated after the initial contract. 

__Mechanisms and Outcomes – Typical CMO Configurations:__ Several recurring context–mechanism–outcome patterns emerge:

* __CMO 1: Strong governance + clear strategy + tech-transfer offsets → better chance of sustained industrial gains.__ In contexts like South Korea (historically) or now perhaps Poland and Indonesia, where governments had a coherent strategy (e.g. localizing production of certain defence systems) and negotiated tech transfers accordingly, the outcome was some enduring local capability. South Korea in the 1980s–90s used offsets (licensed production of F-16s, frigates, etc.) combined with huge domestic R&D effort to leapfrog into an arms producer – today its industries export globally, a long-term outcome of offsets married with national investment. Poland’s offsets for F-16, while not creating a Polish fighter jet, did integrate Polish firms into global supply chains, a stepping stone for those firms to continue international work. Key in these cases is government capacity to manage offsets (dedicated offset bureaus or laws) and to align them with national development plans.
* __CMO 2: Weak governance or corrupt context + offsets mechanism (especially large indirect offsets) → unintended outcomes (inefficiency, corruption, minimal real gains).__ The Czech–Hungary Gripen case fits here: the context of transitional economies with governance vulnerabilities, plus an offsets mechanism that included a lot of indirect investment, led to exploitation by vested interests. The outcome was that some offsets became vehicles for bribery, the procurements themselves lost integrity, and economically the countries might have gotten less than advertised because money flowed to middlemen rather than real projects. Similarly, countries that demanded high offsets but lacked monitoring saw many promised projects quietly fail without public accountability (TI research notes how often there is “no monitoring of what was delivered vs. pledged, and no publication of results”, allowing non-performance to go unchecked).
* __CMO 3: High absorptive capacity context + offsets aimed at integration → outcome of global partnerships.__ This can be seen in cases like Israel and Singapore. These small states have advanced workforces; when they purchase systems (Israel from the U.S., Singapore from various suppliers), they often negotiate offsets that bring local companies into the supply chain. The outcome is that their companies gain credentials and access to markets. Israel turned its offset strategy into a “competitive weapon” on the selling side too – by offering attractive local partnerships to buyers (e.g. joint production in India or Brazil), Israeli firms have sold a lot of defence goods. Essentially, in a high-capacity context, offsets can create win-win collaborations rather than one-off concessions.
* __CMO 4: Context of urgent security need + long-term G2G offset mechanism → outcome of continued offset use even in tight market.__ The new development highlighted by Anicetti (2025) is that even when buyers have less leverage (post-2022 rush for arms), offsets did not vanish because the context (e.g. Poland needing weapons fast) was offset by another mechanism: government-to-government deals where seller states support some form of offsets spread over time. The outcome is that offsets “persist” albeit perhaps in reduced form, because states like Poland still insist on some local involvement as a matter of strategic policy (self-sufficiency) and allied sellers (like the U.S., South Korea) acquiesce as part of deeper defence relationships. This scenario will be interesting to watch: it may redefine offsets as more cooperative industrial partnerships rather than the old model of forced economic return.

__Intended vs Unintended Outcomes:__ The review shows __intended outcomes of offsets__ – technology acquisition, industrial growth, employment, export promotion, strategic autonomy – are often only partially realized. Malaysia intended rapid defence industrialization; the reality was slower incremental gains. The Czech and Hungary intended to revitalize their economies; the reality was modest industrial uptake and a corruption scandal. Strategic autonomy is rarely fully achieved via offsets alone (no offset recipient has yet “graduated” to complete self-reliance in defence production purely thanks to offsets). However, many have increased their strategic capability somewhat – e.g. having local maintenance for fighter jets (so less dependent on foreign help for sustainment) or the ability to produce ammunition domestically. 

The __unintended outcomes__ are numerous: 

- __Corruption and governance costs:__ Offsets can exacerbate rent-seeking. We saw how they can serve as conduits for bribery
. Even when not illegal, they can be doled out to politically connected domestic firms rather than the most efficient ones, fostering cronyism.
Opportunity costs: Money and time spent managing offsets might have been spent on other economic programs. If an offset creates an inefficient factory that survives only on that one contract, the opportunity cost is significant.
- __Dependency or false sense of security:__ Sometimes offsets create an illusion of capability. A local assembly line under license might give a country pride that it “builds” jets, but if it cannot design upgrades or build without imported kits, it may become dependent on the supplier for the long term. India’s experience with licensed production is instructive – it produced jets and tanks under offset-like arrangements for decades but still struggled to indigenously design successors, leading to continued foreign reliance.
- __Delays in procurement:__ Formulating and negotiating offset packages can slow down the acquisition of the main defence item. This occurred in Indonesia where initial offset negotiations stalled programs until clarifications were issued. In fast-moving security crises, such delays can be consequential (this is one reason some Eastern European states in 2022 placed urgent orders without waiting to hash out elaborate offsets).
- __Market distortions:__ As discussed, offsets can lead to cost premiums on contracts. Contractors increase their bid price to cover the expense of offset investments. In effect, the buyer pays for its own offsets. If not carefully assessed, a country might be paying, say, 10–15% more on a defence contract and getting an offset project that might not yield commensurate value. This inefficiency is why economists often criticize offsets. One study noted that most European offset regimes “failed to generate enduring high value” jobs or investments and incurred significant resource misallocation.


__Mitigating the Downsides:__ The literature and case evidence do provide some guidance on mitigating negative outcomes. Transparency International’s 2010 report made concrete recommendations: ensure offsets do not drive procurement choices away from genuine security needs, staff offset management with trained professionals (not ad-hoc military officers) bound by strong ethics codes, disclose conflicts of interest, and critically, __increase transparency and monitoring__ of offset execution. Publishing offset contracts and their fulfilment status can discourage companies and officials from exploiting them clandestinely. Some countries now do this: India, for example, began reporting on offset contract fulfilments in parliamentary committees; Poland’s offset law mandated periodic reports to its parliament. Additionally, using __multipliers and targeted credit__ can incentivize better-quality offsets (as opposed to easy, low-value projects). The Indian and Indonesian policies giving 2–3× credit for high-tech, and Switzerland’s new flexibility, are attempts to focus offsets where they might have the most long-term impact. Careful consideration of __prerequisites (absorptive capacity)__ before finalizing an offset plan is also key. The case studies showed that requiring a foreign supplier to, say, establish a cutting-edge electronics plant is pointless if the country lacks a semiconductor industry; a more suitable offset might be to invest in basic electronics education or a lower-tier assembly which can grow over time. Some experts suggest that offsets should be tied with broader development programs – essentially integrating them with national industrial policy rather than treating them as separate add-ons. 

Finally, __comparative learning__ is improving. Countries now share experiences through forums and studies; for example, the __“success and failures of Gripen offsets in Visegrad”__ [@Lazar_2019] analysis helps newer buyers avoid repeating mistakes. There is also a trend of regional collaboration instead of pure offsets: e.g. the EU’s push for joint procurement with collaborative development aims to distribute industrial work among partners upfront (so each country’s industry gets a share by design, rather than calling it an offset after purchase). This could be seen as an evolution of the offset concept into multilateral co-production, hopefully with more balanced outcomes.

# Conclusion

Defence offsets have been used around the world as an instrument to reconcile the tension between buying advanced weapons abroad and building domestic economic capacity. This realist literature review has shown that the impact of offsets is highly context-dependent. In favourable contexts – where a country has clear strategic goals, sufficient industrial base, and good governance – offsets can indeed trigger positive mechanisms like technology transfer, job creation, and integration of local firms into global supply chains. We saw examples of this in Poland’s sweeping F-16 offsets and in Malaysia’s niche aerospace gains. In such cases, offsets helped jump-start industries or at least gave a boost to technological know-how that would have been hard to acquire otherwise. Offsets can contribute to a nation’s __strategic autonomy__, not by making it fully self-sufficient (a very high bar that even large nations struggle with), but by developing some indigenous support capabilities and diversity of supply. The “insurance” value of offsets is real – countries like Indonesia and Switzerland explicitly use them to ensure that, politically and economically, they are not wholly at the mercy of foreign suppliers [SwissFedCouncil2021OffsetPolicy]. 

However, the review also reveals a sobering reality: __offsets are no magic bullet for defence industrialization__. Many offset programs have produced limited or ephemeral benefits. Frequently, the outcomes fall short of the inflated promises. The Malaysian and numerous other case studies highlight that after decades of offsets, true high-tech self-reliance remains elusive. Moreover, offsets come with __significant unintended consequences__. They tend to raise procurement costs and can lead to inefficient projects that require continued subsidy or collapse once the offset obligation is met [@Kirchwehm2014DefenceOffsets]. The risk of corruption is pronounced – offsets have operated in the shadows of arms deals, enabling patronage and bribery in some instances [@CorruptionTracker_Gripen2021]. This not only wastes resources but can undermine trust in defence institutions. 

A key insight from a realist perspective is that understanding __“what works for whom in what circumstances”__ is crucial. Offsets have worked _better_ when tailored: aligning the mechanism (be it co-production, local R&D, or simple subcontracting) to the country’s actual needs and capabilities. A small state with a robust civilian tech sector might benefit more from software and electronics-related offsets, whereas a larger developing economy might prioritize manufacturing and assembly skills. Timing and longevity matter too – if offsets are given a long horizon to play out (as seen in some G2G agreements with phased investments), they have a better chance to root themselves in the local economy rather than being quick fixes. 

__Policy implications__ from this review suggest a few paths forward. Countries that choose to employ offsets should strengthen transparency and accountability around them: publish offset agreements, track implementation, involve independent audits. This can mitigate corruption and allow course-correction if projects falter. Designing offset policies with flexibility (like multiplier incentives for the most strategic projects) can encourage quality over quantity. It is also wise to invest in __absorptive capacity__ concurrently – e.g. training programs, infrastructure, and supporting industries – so that the high-tech transfers have fertile ground to grow. For the international community and regions like the EU, there is merit in coordinating approaches: Europe’s experience shows that uncontrolled offsets can fragment markets and undermine collective efficiency, hence a balanced approach that preserves critical industries without old-style protectionism is needed. 

Ultimately, defence offsets will likely continue in some form, especially as many countries outside the most advanced tier still view them as one of the few levers they have when negotiating with giant defence contractors. The global trend among advanced economies has been to reduce reliance on offsets, focusing instead on collaborative development or simply buying off the shelf at lower cost. Developing and emerging economies, however, are increasing their use of offsets (as noted, offsets are “increasingly becoming a developing country phenomenon.”). The realist lens suggests that neither outright dismissal nor uncritical embrace of offsets is appropriate. Rather, a nuanced application – learning from past failures, tightening governance, and aligning offsets with realistic national goals – can improve the outcomes of offset policies. In the final analysis, offsets can be __double-edged__: when well-managed in the right context, they are a tool for obtaining value beyond the defence article itself; when mismanaged or mismatched to context, they lead to waste, distortions, and scandals. The literature, enriched with cases from Malaysia to the Visegrád and beyond, provides ample evidence to craft smarter offset strategies that maximize genuine outcomes while minimizing perverse effects. The challenge for policymakers is to heed these lessons so that defence offsets, if used, truly offset the costs of arms purchases with meaningful benefits, rather than becoming costly mirages.
