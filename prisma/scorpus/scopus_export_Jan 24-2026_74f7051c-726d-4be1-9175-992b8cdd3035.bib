	abstract = {This study examines how Indonesia can advance its Defense Industrialization 5.0 goals by adopting an Enforced Autonomy Model-an approach that treats industrial development not as a market-driven evolution but as a statemandated mission. Through qualitative policy analysis and diagnostic tools like the Ishikawa diagram and Arms Production Ladder, the paper identifies persistent challenges that hinder progress, including fragmented governance, outdated technology, limited R&D investment, and weak integration of local suppliers. These challenges, while well-known, are often addressed through voluntary policies that lack binding force. The Enforced Autonomy Model proposed in this study introduces a shift in perspective: it argues that without enforcement mechanisms-such as presidential-level authority, mandatory local content rules, and structured talent pipelines-Indonesia will remain dependent on foreign suppliers and struggle to meet long-term strategic goals. Drawing lessons from countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Singapore, the paper demonstrates that meaningful transformation in the defense sector requires strong political leadership, clear targets, and institutional accountability. To operationalize this approach, the study outlines six strategic roadmaps covering human capital, production line modernization, supply chain development, product innovation, export promotion, and governance reform. Each roadmap includes enforceable targets tied to legal or regulatory instruments, ensuring alignment across ministries, state-owned enterprises, and research institutions. The findings suggest that by embedding enforcement into national policy, Indonesia can not only achieve the targets set in its 2045 development agenda but also emerge as a key defense supplier for the Global South. In doing so, the country would shift from being a passive participant in global defense markets to a proactive industrial actor capable of innovation, autonomy, and strategic relevance. © (c) 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) encourage coal-dependent emerging economies to phase out coal and transition to renewable energy. However, JETPs face significant obstacles, creating tensions with international economic law. Local content requirements (LCRs) represent a particularly problematic regulatory barrier to energy transitions. This article thus examines whether international economic law expedites or obstructs Asia's energy transition, and whether LCRs are incompatible with international economic law. To answer these questions, this article juxtaposes LCR provisions in JETPs and domestic regulations in two case studies: Indonesia and Vietnam. It then contextualizes LCR costs and benefits before examining tensions with international economic law and potential state defences justifying LCRs. It culminates in suggesting how LCRs could be designed to neutralize such tensions. This article argues that international economic law complements, rather than collides with, energy transition goals and that LCRs are not anathema to international economic law, as long as they are designed and implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This chapter builds a political economy framework for addressing how the Global Defense Industry's (GDI) affects fragile and corrupt states. Prior work demonstrates that during the post-Cold War era, military spending and arms imports are linked to greater FDI flows for only corrupt economies (Drezner and Hite-Rubin 2014; Hite-Rubin 2015). This dynamic is troubling because high corruption within these states, along with greater rent-seeking and security risks, brought on by rising military spending and arms imports, is a recipe for “development in reverse” (Collier et al. 2003). The chapter interrogates four hypotheses for why this military-FDI link manifests only where corruption is more endemic. The first two hypotheses are sourced from defense economics and international relations literatures and found to be lacking. Hite-Rubin then develops two additional hypotheses that conceptualize state-level corruption as a mediating variable. Hypothesis 3 outlines why GDI sales are more likely to involve defense-offset arrangements with high FDI “buy back” to corrupt states. Hypothesis 4 posits that the GDI's illiberal trade practices distort markets and incentivize corruption and patronage politics. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {In the last twenty years, the EU has made increasingly greater efforts to boost defence cooperation among MS. To strengthen the EDTIB and avoid duplication of capabilities, the EU has encouraged “European preference” in arms procurement and MS’ defence collaborative projects, also by seeking to expunge defence offsets from the single market. Against this backdrop, on 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. What impact has the war in Ukraine had on EU defence cooperation? Has the war impacted MS in a similar fashion or unevenly, reinforcing defence integration dynamics for some, while kickstarting disintegration for others? Two years on, a thorough analysis of the impact of the war on EU defence cooperation is still missing. This paper fills this gap by exploring three levels of analysis–arms collaboration, arms procurement, and offsets–and by comparing pre-invasion evidence with data from the post-invasion period. The analysis suggests that the Russo-Ukrainian war has negatively impacted EU defence cooperation, potentially increasing both fragmentation and non-EU dependencies. However, although MS’ threat perception and their ability to reap industrial benefits remain important to explain EU defence cooperation, integration or disintegration dynamics do not neatly map onto the geographical or size divides identified by the literature. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction The Department of Defense aims to maintain mission readiness of its service members. Therefore, it is important to understand factors associated with treatment seeking in order to identify areas of prevention and intervention early in a soldier's career that can promote positive functioning and increase their likelihood of seeking mental health care when necessary. Method Using a theory of planned behavior lens, this study identified potential barriers (risk) and facilitators (resilience) to treatment seeking among 24,717 soldiers-in-training who participated in the New Soldiers Study component of the "Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers" (Army STARRS). Approval for this study was granted by the University of Iowa IRB # 201706739. Hierarchal linear regression modeling and independent samples t-tests were used to examine associations between demographics and study variables, intersections of risk and resilience, and to explore differences in the likelihood of seeking help based on mental health diagnoses. Results A four-stage hierarchical linear regression was conducted, using likelihood of help-seeking as the dependent variable, to identify the most salient factors related to help-seeking. "Step one" of the analysis revealed soldiers-in-training who identified as female, Hispanic or Other ethnicity, and married, divorced, or separated reported a greater likelihood of seeking help. "Step two" of the analysis indicated soldiers-in-training with a history of sexual trauma, experience of impaired parenting, and clinical levels of mental health symptomatology (anxiety, depression, PTSD) reported a greater likelihood of seeking help. Inversely, soldiers-in-training with a history of emotional trauma and parental absence/separation reported a lower likelihood of seeking help. "Step three" of the analysis demonstrated soldiers-intraining with a prior history of seeking help and larger social networks had a greater likelihood of seeking help. "Step four" of the analysis revealed several interactive effects between risk and resilience factors. Specifically, soldiers-in-training who reported greater depressive symptomatology in combination with prior history of treatment seeking reported a greater likelihood of help seeking, whereas soldiers-in-training who reported prior sexual trauma and PTSD in combination with large social networks reported a lower likelihood of seeking help. Finally, a greater percentage of soldiers-in-training with clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD indicated they would likely seek help in comparison to soldiers-intraining without clinical symptoms. Conclusion Findings suggest few soldiers-in-training are likely to seek help when experiencing a problem. General efforts to encourage help-seeking when needed are warranted with particular focus on subsets of soldiers-in-training (eg, men, those with a history of some adverse childhood experiences). Strengths of this study include the examination of a large sample of soldiers-in-training to identify possible leverage points for early intervention or prevention prior to entering stressful military operating environments. Limitations of this study include the examination of only one military branch and exclusion of soldiers not "in-training." Future studies could consider replicating the current study using a sample of military personnel longitudinally to track behavioral trends as well as looking at military populations outside of basic combat training. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {The European defense-industrial panorama is rapidly changing. Among all the initiatives conducted, the European Defense Fund (EDF) and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PeSCo) in defense can be easily considered as proof of a revived interest in defense-industrial cooperation. Given this European activism, it is not surprising that the academic literature has focused on the main actors and the main strategic and economic drivers that have spurred European defense-industrial cooperation. However, the scholarly literature on the topic has erroneously over-emphasized the cooperative elements, while underestimating the peculiarities of a policy-field which remains characterized by both cooperative and competitive dynamics. Indeed, notwithstanding the presence of stable alliances, common regulations in defense procurement and a number of transnational business groups, the European defense-industrial field remains also fragmented in terms of both supply and demand. The article has two goals: first, it proposes a Liberal-Intergovernmentalist research agenda to explain the complex mix of cooperation and competition in this policy-field. Second, it aims to reflect on methodological issues in studying European armaments policies. Overall, the article wants to stimulate a constructive discussion, both from a theoretical and a methodological point of view, on a peculiar policy area that acts as an interface of industrial, technological and defense policies and lies at the intersection of International Relations (IR) traditional distinction between low and high politics. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Gender disparity in academic medicine has been well described in the civilian sector. This has not yet been evaluated in the military health system where hundreds of female surgeons are practicing. Military service limits factors such as part time work and control over time spent away from family, which are often cited as contributors to the pay and promotion gap in civilian academic medicine. The military has explicit policies to limit discrimination based on gender. Pay between men and women is equal as it is based on rank and time in rank. One would expect to see less disparity in promotion through the academic ranks for military female surgeons given this otherwise equal treatment. This has not previously been objectively tracked or reported. It is beneficial to characterize the military academic medicine gender gap and benchmark against national data to define the academic gender gap and lay the groundwork for future work to identify factors contributing to the observed difference. Material and Methods: This study was granted exemption from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) Internal Review Board (IRB). The Uniformed Services University (USU) Department of Surgery academic appointment list was reviewed to assess female representation in the categories of Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Other. Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and the US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) were assessed for total numbers of female surgeons on active duty, and numbers were compared with nationally published Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) data using a logistic regression model. Results: There was a higher proportion of women in academic positions in the civilian cohort than in the military cohort (OR: 1.84; CI: 1.53-2.21, p <. 0001). This difference was observed at every level of academic achievement. A higher percentage of women were observed at lower levels of professorship than at higher levels; instructors were more likely to be women than assistant professor (OR: 1.44, CI:1.16-1.79), associate professor (OR: 2.24, CI: 1.77-2.84), or full professor (OR:4.61, CI: 3.57-5.94). Conclusions: Fewer female surgeons in military medicine hold academic appointment when compared with their counterparts in civilian medicine. Similar to the civilian sector, military academic surgery also demonstrates less likelihood of female representation in higher academic stations. This discrepancy in representation follows a linear trend over the different ranks. This discrepancy has not been previously documented. The military offers a unique opportunity to study the issue of gender imbalance in academic promotion practices given its otherwise equal treatment of males and females. Additional studies will be necessary to understand uniformed female surgeons' barriers to academic advancement. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2019.},

Whereas major accounts of integration depict defence policy as a least likely case, our process-tracing analysis shows that the EU's recent challenge of defence offsets was a case of supranational self-empowerment. We theorize two consecutive strategies of judicial politics, which the Commission employed at different policy stages to overcome opposition from Member States and defence firms against domestic policy change: judicialized law-making and opportunistic enforcement. Both strategies depend on three scope conditions: expansive case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), its fit with policy priorities of the Commission and a credible threat of follow-up litigation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The rising costs of defence equipment and the significant contraction of defence spending have resulted in an environment that favoured the use of offset policies, the latter becoming increasingly demanding in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The chapter analyses the role of offsets on the process of integration of defence equipment markets, with a specific focus on the EU. Particular attention is given to the offset-relevant regulation and practice and to their recent evolution in the EU following the adoption of European Directive on defence and security procurement (81/81/EC). Offsets play a dual role with regard to the integration of defence industries: on one hand they can be trade-distorting and contribute to the survival of inefficient suppliers in arms importing countries; on the other hand, they can contribute in overcoming barriers that may otherwise prevent some potentially efficient suppliers from accessing the supply chains of the big system integrators. The chapter draws the attention on the need to complement the regulatory evolution by further initiatives aiming at improving the access of non-incumbent suppliers to the supply chains of the large defence system integrators. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Poland's Warsaw-based Air Force Institute of Technology (ITWL) and the ITB Moratex Security Institute of Lodz are developing a ballistic protection system for tactical helicopters in anticipation of looming requirements in the country. The system is designed for military, police and border-protection helicopters, and light aircrafts to shield against fragments and small-arms fire. The armor will comprise adjustable composite ballistic panels based on polyethylene, installed either externally on the airframe or placed on the floor of cargo and passenger areas. The protection system is undergoing laboratory testing and ITWL has offered it to Poland's Ministry of National Defense to increase the survivability of helicopters. The Military Institute for Armament Technology is participating in the Bulgaria-led NATO program to design a system to reduce the vulnerability of helicopters to rocket-propelled grenades.},

	abstract = {Offsets or industrial participation have become an increasingly important part of arms procurement, with the promise of economic benefits often being an important justification for spending large amounts of public money. However, the limited but growing research on the subject casts doubt on the net value of defence offsets to national economies. An important aspect af any offset agreement is its impact at the regional and local levels. This paper contributes to the continuing debate on the topic, by undertaking a case study of the South African experience, focusing on the Coega Industrial Development Zone, which is situated on the coast some 22 kilometres north-east of Port Elizabeth. The endurance of the Coega IDZ (Industrial Development Zone) project in the face of considerable national criticism from business, other provinces, and civil society, can be explained in part by its identification as the flagship of the NIP (National Industrial Participation) programme, and its reciprocal role in helping the private and public justification of the Strategic Defence Programme (SDP). The study finds that industrial participation schemes do attract and focus investment, but that they also deform efforts at more integrated development at sub-national levels, and further fragment the terrain for industrial policy conceptualisation. It suggests that the offsets targeted for the Eastern Cape do relatively little to address backlogs in development in the region. © 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},
