	abstract = {This study examines how Indonesia can advance its Defense Industrialization 5.0 goals by adopting an Enforced Autonomy Model-an approach that treats industrial development not as a market-driven evolution but as a statemandated mission. Through qualitative policy analysis and diagnostic tools like the Ishikawa diagram and Arms Production Ladder, the paper identifies persistent challenges that hinder progress, including fragmented governance, outdated technology, limited R&D investment, and weak integration of local suppliers. These challenges, while well-known, are often addressed through voluntary policies that lack binding force. The Enforced Autonomy Model proposed in this study introduces a shift in perspective: it argues that without enforcement mechanisms-such as presidential-level authority, mandatory local content rules, and structured talent pipelines-Indonesia will remain dependent on foreign suppliers and struggle to meet long-term strategic goals. Drawing lessons from countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Singapore, the paper demonstrates that meaningful transformation in the defense sector requires strong political leadership, clear targets, and institutional accountability. To operationalize this approach, the study outlines six strategic roadmaps covering human capital, production line modernization, supply chain development, product innovation, export promotion, and governance reform. Each roadmap includes enforceable targets tied to legal or regulatory instruments, ensuring alignment across ministries, state-owned enterprises, and research institutions. The findings suggest that by embedding enforcement into national policy, Indonesia can not only achieve the targets set in its 2045 development agenda but also emerge as a key defense supplier for the Global South. In doing so, the country would shift from being a passive participant in global defense markets to a proactive industrial actor capable of innovation, autonomy, and strategic relevance. © (c) 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to establish a systematically constructed defence offset technology transfer (TT) process description and to identify the process pain points and critical success factors from the supplier perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A novel integrated case study and Straussian grounded theory approach under the interpretative assumptions and purposive sampling in a global defence industry organisation are presented. Findings: The TT is approached from the process modelling point of view, and a detailed operations description covering the end-to-end TT process across a defence industrial participation project is presented. The findings suggest that local recipient’s management, financial resources and planning, supply chain management and local production planning are the main factors of an efficient process. Research limitations/implications: This is a single case study, only reflecting the supplier view. Future research could explore the other dimensions of the process to confirm the identified factors playing a role over time. Originality/value: To date, the body of TT research has focused on the factors influencing the technology absorption and the identification of meta mechanisms between the supplier and recipient organisations in a context of a multinational corporation and as an intra-firm activity, providing little insight to the actual practical operational level TT process. This study seeks to fill this gap by advancing a more profound understanding of the process activities and the main factors through which the local recipient organisation can best influence the project’s success and manage the inter-organisational TT operations more effectively in a highly technologically complex operational environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Economic and trade relations between Russia and Finland have been transforming under the influence of global and regional trends. Russia has always emphasized its interest in enhancing mutually beneficial cooperation with Finland based on investments, technology transfer, industrial cooperation and increasing the share of non-resource non-energy goods in turnover. There is an interest in bringing high-tech and high-quality Finnish industrial products and providing them an opportunity to participate in large-scale public industrial projects. Russia is at the same time a substantial threat and opportunity in Finnish foreign policy. Finland's foreign policy towards Russia is based on two pillars: defense (the need for military deterrence) and economic (the need for broad relations). The main focus of the article is on this second pillar. In fact, so established and sacred was this pillar of foreign policy that the term ‘Finlandisation’ arose, many decades ago, as a description of when a country is induced to favour, or refrain from opposing, the interests of a more powerful country, despite not being politically allied to it. History and geography are two critical factors that have made Finland and Russia inherent economic partners. Finland's management of relations with Russia is a unique example that has set an example for many countries worldwide. The economic integration between Finland and Russia has occurred almost by itself without any tremendous public effort. However, determination in policy-making can help integrate Finland and Russia's economies even further. The complicated relations with Russia can be seen as Finland's historical dilemma: neighboring Russia but now a part of the West, Finland's room for maneuver is not self-evident and requires constant management. Research Question: All things considered, it begs the question in this regard, it begs the question how have economic factors affected the direction of Finland's foreign policy towards Russia? Examining the order of this process is also essential. Research Hypothesis: This article hypothesizes that energy, along with trade in goods and services, are the most important economic variables that have led to the pursuit of resilience and normative strategies, resulting in mutual vulnerability in Finnish-Russian interactions. Methodology (and Theoretical Framework if there are): The paper uses the theory of asymmetric interdependence based on Keohen and Nye vulnerabilities. Accordingly, the economy is sensitive to the extent that it is exposed to costs inflicted from the outside before policies are introduced to change the situation; it is vulnerable to the extent that it is exposed to costs inflicted from the outside after policies have been applied. If outside costs can be imposed on a country in the form of higher prices for a commodity that is important to its economy, for instance, oil, then that country is sensitive. Suppose the country has some means to change this situation, either by switching its source of imports using trade sanctions in some way by military force. Then it is not vulnerable. If prices of these commodities go up and the country can do nothing about it, it is both sensitive and vulnerable. This distinction can be beneficial when dealing with economic interdependence. Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can represent the entire population or a sample of a population. The research method is a combination of descriptive statistics and field research. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread). Descriptive statistics, in short, help describe and understand the features of a specific data set by giving short summaries about the sample and measures of the data. Results and discussion: Russia offer significant opportunities for the Finnish business sector. Finland's trade has overgrown in the 2000s, and Russia is becoming Finland's most important trade partner. Conclusion: The study's findings suggest that Russia is using energy to advance its policies towards Finland with a geo-economics approach. Finland is also vulnerable in trade in goods, but it has the upper hand in services. The sum of these two constants has led to interdependence in the relationship between them. Besides Finnish Russian trade's development, the business between the two affects more. Among the other cities in the development corridor, Finnish knowledge and competitiveness help Northern Europe's economic development. A recession outcome would need an escalation in war and/or more severe deterioration in energy and raw material markets. Nonetheless, growth will decline and inflation will spike. © 2022,Central Eurasia Studies. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Transfer of technology (TOT) is a contentious issue in the international defence trade. In 2019 it was estimated to form at least 40%, or $123 billion USD, of total international defence trade. Whilst purchasing nations set requirements for TOT within their industrial participation (IP) policies, there is often a mismatch between the scale and type of technology suppliers can offer and the buyer’s technological absorption capability (TAC). This persistent tension between ambition and reality frequently strains the buyer-supplier relationship. Thus, understanding how TAC can be enhanced is of vital importance. This paper defines TAC in the international defence acquisition and offsets context and determines the factors for successful TAC. The paper focusses on the potential challenges for successful TAC and offers recommendations on how to enhance TAC. This research is limited to the context of Southeast Asia.

The one-way defence trade is not only out of sync with India’s traditional demand for technology transfer and license production from its arms suppliers, but is also contrary to Make in India initiative of the Indian government. It is, therefore, imperative for New Delhi in particular to find an industrial solution to its increasing yet skewed defence trade relationship with the Washington. Besides demanding industrial benefits from all possible defence deals with the US in the future, New Delhi has to do a few more things to deepen the industry-to-industry cooperation with the US. Among others, it has to use its defence offset policy carefully to facilitate greater military-specific technology transfers for its industry; and at the same time lay a strong foundation for a robust in-house industrial base which can receive and absorb all such transfers. © 2018 Indian Council of World Affairs.},

Offsets are usually expected to yield technological or industrial benefits to the purchasing country (e.g. countertrade, technology transfers, or additional jobs) and military buyers often require suppliers to make offsets available "cost-free." The authors argued previously that such strategies achieve little of value to buyers that lack market power and are unnecessary otherwise, since purchasers with the market power to extract more value for money from foreign suppliers can do so anyway. This article also focuses on the supply side of offset deals. The USA is the world's largest defence offsets supplier but the US government opposes offsets demands as economically inefficient and trade distorting. Even if offsets are inefficient and trade distorting, they may still benefit a materiel-exporting country such as the USA as they may induce exports and create associated benefits for the offsets provider. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {A historical review of the evolution and development of engineering and technology generally in Nigeria is first presented. Major efforts at indigenous capacity building in the Nigerian oil industry did not commence until about 60 years after the first exploration efforts and ten years after oil discovery at Oloibiri. It was observed that in the last three decades, significant efforts have been made at establishing some institutions and infrastructure necessary for technology transfer and indigenous capacity building. Unfortunately, important requirements like favourable economic and political climate and essential linkages have been largely missing. A reliable survey and database of indigenous technology that can be applied in the oil industry is also missing. A general appraisal of the oil industry shows that while there is significant local expertise in Engineering services in such areas as drilling fluids engineering, PVT analysis, pipeline pigging and light facilities engineering, indigenous technological capacity is still very low and there is high dependence on foreign technology. We reiterate the well-known fact that ownership of production cannot be separated from the technology of production hence the need for a state-backed institutional framework for sustainable indigenous technology development and promotion of local content in the Nigerian oil industry as has been done in other counties and in the Nigerian defense industry. © © 2005, Society of Petroleum Engineers Inc.},

Taiwanese government procurement is one of the most important sources of technological development. Over the past 10 years, this performance has not been remarkable in obtaining improved rising defense technology using the offset (namely, Industrial Cooperation Program, ICP). The main objective of this paper is to discuss the problems with Taiwan's ICP and propose a four-stage approach for Taiwan's ICP mechanism detailed improvements are suggested for Stage I and Stage II. F-16 fighter coproduction was used as an example to simulate Stages I and II in the four-stage approach process, considering all three levels of technology, economics and national security, to establish a set of fuzzy multiple criteria decision mode to identify the evaluative criteria variables and project item's order for ICP project. This decision mode was identified as a workable method. © 2002 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The contract, valued at about US$86 million, is for 90 command launch units (CLUs), 526 missile rounds, plus training systems, contractor logistic support and spares. Delivery is scheduled for mid-2006 to mid-2007. The announcement came at the end of a 15-month competitive procurement that included head-to-head performance testing of rival systems. "The [Norwegian] Army has desired this capability for a long period of time, so I am therefore very glad that we now have this in place," said Norwegian Minister of Defence Kristin Krohn Devoid. The contract contains provisions for the Raytheon-Lockheed Martin Javelin Joint Venture, in conjunction with Saab, to provide a unique Norwegian field tactical trainer adapted to the Norwegian national training centre, an interface device that enables the tripod of the Aerospatiale Eryx unguided anti-tank weapon to be employed with Javelin, and new terrain for the basic-skills trainer that is distinctive to Norway's requirements. Under the terms of an industrial participation agreement, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin will provide high-technology workshare to a number of Norwegian defence contractors, including Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace, Nammo, Vinghxg, Dyno and NATECH. © 2005 Jane's Information Group.
