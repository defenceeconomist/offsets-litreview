	abstract = {This study examines how Indonesia can advance its Defense Industrialization 5.0 goals by adopting an Enforced Autonomy Model-an approach that treats industrial development not as a market-driven evolution but as a statemandated mission. Through qualitative policy analysis and diagnostic tools like the Ishikawa diagram and Arms Production Ladder, the paper identifies persistent challenges that hinder progress, including fragmented governance, outdated technology, limited R&D investment, and weak integration of local suppliers. These challenges, while well-known, are often addressed through voluntary policies that lack binding force. The Enforced Autonomy Model proposed in this study introduces a shift in perspective: it argues that without enforcement mechanisms-such as presidential-level authority, mandatory local content rules, and structured talent pipelines-Indonesia will remain dependent on foreign suppliers and struggle to meet long-term strategic goals. Drawing lessons from countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Singapore, the paper demonstrates that meaningful transformation in the defense sector requires strong political leadership, clear targets, and institutional accountability. To operationalize this approach, the study outlines six strategic roadmaps covering human capital, production line modernization, supply chain development, product innovation, export promotion, and governance reform. Each roadmap includes enforceable targets tied to legal or regulatory instruments, ensuring alignment across ministries, state-owned enterprises, and research institutions. The findings suggest that by embedding enforcement into national policy, Indonesia can not only achieve the targets set in its 2045 development agenda but also emerge as a key defense supplier for the Global South. In doing so, the country would shift from being a passive participant in global defense markets to a proactive industrial actor capable of innovation, autonomy, and strategic relevance. © (c) 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {Introduction Force readiness and disease prevention are critical responsibilities for military physicians. The prevalence of chronic noncommunicable diseases such as obesity and type II diabetes has been increasing among active duty service members. The Department of Defense spends over 3 billion dollars annually managing these conditions. Despite known links between lifestyle factors and disease, lifestyle and performance medicine (LPM) is not commonly integrated into medical education. This research aims to assess military medical students' knowledge, perceptions, and preparedness regarding LPM. Materials and Methods An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved survey among a select group of medical students participating in the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) or attending the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) was performed. The survey was distributed via the Student Association of Military Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons email list and military social media pages. The survey intended to gather student perspectives and preparedness to incorporate LPM into future practice. Demographics data were also collected and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and R-studio. Results Of 107 students across 24 medical institutions, 95% felt LPM was relevant to their careers as military physicians. However, only 45% felt adequately prepared by their institutions, and only 30% felt they gained in-depth experience regarding LPM skills like nutrition and exercise prescriptions in medical school. Notably, 78% thought their medical institutions should dedicate more time to LPM in the medical school curriculum. Discussion Most students in this study do not feel adequately prepared to incorporate LPM interventions and think they would benefit from more LPM training in their medical school curriculum. These results are consistent with previous studies performed among civilian medical students. This study was conducted exclusively among military medical students, many indicated that they feel the principles of LPM are important to force readiness and missions preparedness. However, they also feel that they lack the skills necessary to adequately integrate LPM into their future practice. This study has several limitations. Responses were collected voluntarily in a non-randomized fashion leaving the possibility for selection bias. Additionally, the survey was available for 4 weeks in the summer of 2024. The methods in which the survey was collected makes so an exact response rate cannot be calculated. However, this study offers valuable insight into the demand for LPM education among current military medical students and the implications LPM can have on future force health and deployment readiness. Conclusions Our findings underscore an expectation among military medical students to integrate more comprehensive LPM education within military medical training programs. By enhancing LPM education, military medical students may be better prepared to address noncommunicable diseases such as diabetes and obesity. This in turn may have broader implications as it pertains to improved force readiness and health outcomes. © 2025 The Association of Military Surgeons of the United States. All rights reserved.

	abstract = {Introduction Wastewater surveillance is an important technique to monitor public health and is being studied extensively for pandemic prevention, force health protection and readiness, and as a potential early warning system for chem-bio defense. Wastewater surveillance has traditionally relied on techniques such as quantitative PCR or targeted sequencing, both of which are microbe- or disease-specific tools. Newer pan-viral metagenomics strategies may provide higher specificity for pathogens of interest, resulting in a lower false negative rate and reduced sequencing of undesired background nucleic acids. One such system, VirCapSeq-VERT, has been developed to target all vertebrate virus pathogens; until recently, its application has been limited to clinical samples. The objective of this study was to use VirCapSeq-VERT to interrogate wastewater samples from the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Colorado Springs, Colorado, to determine its utility in assessing complex samples and its potential application in public health surveillance. Materials and Methods Biweekly samples were analyzed from February 2022 through May 2023. Samples were collected from the wastewater treatment facility at USAFA before treatment and stored at -20 °C until total nucleic acid (tNA: DNA and RNA) extraction. tNA was then subject to the probe-based capture system, VirCapSeq, and run through a collection of public bioinformatics pipelines to identify captured viral pathogens and perform phylogenetic analysis. It was determined by the USAFA IRB that the study was non-human subject research and was deemed exempt. Results In total, 68 families of viruses were identified, comprising thousands of individual strains. This study focused on viruses responsible for gastrointestinal dysfunction as a test of the use of the VirCapSeq-VERT to identify human pathogenic viruses within a complex and highly enriched biological sample. Four enteric viruses dominated the wastewater samples, with Adenoviridae most prevalent before the cadet winter recess (December 17, 2022-January 4, 2023) and Astroviridae most abundant thereafter. Conclusion Although gastroenteritis outbreaks at USAFA are commonly attributed to norovirus because of clinical presentation and the acute nature of the illness - often diagnosed and treated without confirmatory stool testing - this virus was not found in high prevalence in these wastewater samples. Among adenoviruses, F serotype 41 predominated, suggesting a role in gastrointestinal infections among the cadet population. Phylogenetic investigation of adenovirus and norovirus exposed common variants with seasonal distributions. These findings may prompt correlational studies to assess the clinical predictive capability of VirCapSeq-VERT and to determine the utility of wastewater monitoring as an outbreak early warning system. © 2024 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States.},

	abstract = {In the White Paper for European Defence–Readiness 2030, the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) has a central role in the renewed impetus towards a European defence pillar triggered by the changes in the European geopolitical landscape. The EDTIB is a crucial pillar since it is required to produce and supply the weapons systems needed to augment EU states' military capabilities. Recognising its strategic importance, the Commission published the first-ever European Defence Industrial Strategy that seeks to increase intra-EU defence industrial cooperation and promote collaborative defence equipment development and procurement. The paper sets out to examine the degree of connectedness among major European defence industries applying a quantile connectedness approach to examine the degree and direction of connectedness among 15 major European defence companies. The estimations span the period from January 2018 to February 2024, which allows for a total of 1453 daily stock price observations per company. Results reported herein suggest the presence of a strong total connectedness among these major European defence industries. The findings reveal three broad groupings with respect to net total directional connectedness: a net-transmitting group, a net-receiving group of defence industries and finally a group that exhibits mixed connectedness. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Introduction:The National Defense Authorization Act of 2017 indicated the need for a national strategy to improve trauma care among military treatment facilities (MTFs). Part of the proposed strategy to improve trauma outcomes was to convert identified MTFs into verified trauma centers. The American College of Surgeons (ACS) verifies trauma centers through an evaluation process based on available resources at a facility. It has been proven that trauma centers, specifically those verified by the ACS, have improved trauma outcomes. In 2017, we implemented steps to become a level III trauma program, according to the standards for designation by the state and verification through the ACS. The goal of this retrospective review is to evaluate the impact of this implementation with regard to both patient care and the MTF. Materials and Methods:Data from a single-MTF trauma registry from 2018, at the initiation of the trauma program, to present were reviewed. Outcomes were selected based upon the ACS verification criteria. Specifically, emergency department length of stay (ED LOS), nonsurgical admissions, injury severity score, diversion rates, and time to operating room were reviewed. Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-tests. Institutional review board (IRB) approval was not required for this study as it was performed as a quality improvement project using deidentified data. Results:ED LOS decreased significantly after implementation of the trauma program from an average of 6.43h in 2018 to 4.73h in 2019 and 4.6h in 2020 (P<.04). Nonsurgical admissions decreased significantly from 57.8% in 2018, with rates of < 20% in all subsequent years (P< .01). The average injury severity score increased from 5.61 in 2018 to 7.52 in 2020 (P<.01) and 7.27 in 2021 (P<.01). Diversion rates also decreased from >5% in 2018 to 0% in 2021. Conclusions:The establishment of a trauma program in accordance with the standards of the ACS for verification improved metrics of care for trauma patients at our MTF. This implementation as part of the local trauma system also led to increased injury severity seen by the MTF, which enhances readiness for its providers. © 2023 Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {Research is foundational for evidence-based management of patients. Clinical research, however, takes time to plan, conduct, and disseminate-a luxury that is rarely available during a public health emergency. The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) developed a single institutional review board (IRB), with a vision to establish a rapid review resource for a network focused on clinical research of emerging pathogens in the United States. A core aspect of successful initiation of research during a pandemic or epidemic is the ability to operationalize an approach for rapid ethical review of human subject research and conduct those reviews at multiple sites-without losing any of the substantive aspects of ethics review. This process must be cultivated in anticipation of a public health emergency. US guidance for operationalizing IRB review for multisite research in a public health emergency is not well studied and processes are not well established. UNMC sought to address operational gaps and identify the unique procedural needs of rapid response single IRB (RR-sIRB) review of multisite research by conducting a series of preparedness exercises to develop and test the RR-sIRB model. For decades, emergency responder, healthcare, and public health organizations have conducted emergency preparedness exercises to test requirements for emergency response. In this article, we describe 2 types of simulation exercises conducted by UNMC: workshops and tabletops. This effort represents a unique use of emergency preparedness exercises to develop, refine, and test rapid review functions for an sIRB and to validate readiness of regulatory research processes. Such processes are crucial for conducting rapid, ethical, and sound clinical research in public health emergencies. © Abigail E. Lowe et al., 2022; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2022.},

Design/methodology/approach: A novel integrated case study and Straussian grounded theory approach under the interpretative assumptions and purposive sampling in a global defence industry organisation are presented. Findings: The TT is approached from the process modelling point of view, and a detailed operations description covering the end-to-end TT process across a defence industrial participation project is presented. The findings suggest that local recipient’s management, financial resources and planning, supply chain management and local production planning are the main factors of an efficient process. Research limitations/implications: This is a single case study, only reflecting the supplier view. Future research could explore the other dimensions of the process to confirm the identified factors playing a role over time. Originality/value: To date, the body of TT research has focused on the factors influencing the technology absorption and the identification of meta mechanisms between the supplier and recipient organisations in a context of a multinational corporation and as an intra-firm activity, providing little insight to the actual practical operational level TT process. This study seeks to fill this gap by advancing a more profound understanding of the process activities and the main factors through which the local recipient organisation can best influence the project’s success and manage the inter-organisational TT operations more effectively in a highly technologically complex operational environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Introduction The Department of Defense aims to maintain mission readiness of its service members. Therefore, it is important to understand factors associated with treatment seeking in order to identify areas of prevention and intervention early in a soldier's career that can promote positive functioning and increase their likelihood of seeking mental health care when necessary. Method Using a theory of planned behavior lens, this study identified potential barriers (risk) and facilitators (resilience) to treatment seeking among 24,717 soldiers-in-training who participated in the New Soldiers Study component of the "Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers" (Army STARRS). Approval for this study was granted by the University of Iowa IRB # 201706739. Hierarchal linear regression modeling and independent samples t-tests were used to examine associations between demographics and study variables, intersections of risk and resilience, and to explore differences in the likelihood of seeking help based on mental health diagnoses. Results A four-stage hierarchical linear regression was conducted, using likelihood of help-seeking as the dependent variable, to identify the most salient factors related to help-seeking. "Step one" of the analysis revealed soldiers-in-training who identified as female, Hispanic or Other ethnicity, and married, divorced, or separated reported a greater likelihood of seeking help. "Step two" of the analysis indicated soldiers-in-training with a history of sexual trauma, experience of impaired parenting, and clinical levels of mental health symptomatology (anxiety, depression, PTSD) reported a greater likelihood of seeking help. Inversely, soldiers-in-training with a history of emotional trauma and parental absence/separation reported a lower likelihood of seeking help. "Step three" of the analysis demonstrated soldiers-intraining with a prior history of seeking help and larger social networks had a greater likelihood of seeking help. "Step four" of the analysis revealed several interactive effects between risk and resilience factors. Specifically, soldiers-in-training who reported greater depressive symptomatology in combination with prior history of treatment seeking reported a greater likelihood of help seeking, whereas soldiers-in-training who reported prior sexual trauma and PTSD in combination with large social networks reported a lower likelihood of seeking help. Finally, a greater percentage of soldiers-in-training with clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD indicated they would likely seek help in comparison to soldiers-intraining without clinical symptoms. Conclusion Findings suggest few soldiers-in-training are likely to seek help when experiencing a problem. General efforts to encourage help-seeking when needed are warranted with particular focus on subsets of soldiers-in-training (eg, men, those with a history of some adverse childhood experiences). Strengths of this study include the examination of a large sample of soldiers-in-training to identify possible leverage points for early intervention or prevention prior to entering stressful military operating environments. Limitations of this study include the examination of only one military branch and exclusion of soldiers not "in-training." Future studies could consider replicating the current study using a sample of military personnel longitudinally to track behavioral trends as well as looking at military populations outside of basic combat training. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {Singapore is a tiny island state that since independence from the British in 1965 has managed to develop a formidable defence-industrial base. Singapore’s policymakers prefer to use the term defence ‘ecosystem’, as it more aptly captures all the diverse elements contributing to arms production capacity, within and beyond, the industrial base. This is often referred to as technological absorption capability, and includes specialist supply chains, R&D institutions, skilled engineering and design personnel and high technology universities. As part of a conceptualised model highlighting the principal facets in the development of Singapore’s defence-industrial ecosystem, this chapter examines the importance of proactive government strategy, treating the core defence company, ST Engineering, as a strategic industry. Technology development is fostered via indigenous R&D investment, foreign technological partnerships and defence offset. This unique defence-industrial model is framed within the country’s ‘Total Defence’ policy, emphasising the significance of technological development through civil-military integration. Singapore’s defence-industrial eco-system is a success story, and offers the potential for emulation by other emerging states seeking accelerated defence industrialisation. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Keith Hartley and Jean Belin; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {This chapter examines to what extent Europe's governments and defence contractors cooperate to provide European Armed Forces with military capabilities. Defence industrial cooperation has evolved as almost the default policy option for European powers to develop large military platforms. Yet, there is no uniform trend, but large variation across countries (for example, France versus Germany), across sectors (land versus air versus sea), and with regards to the sources of cooperation (for example, government induced versus investment driven). The chapter shows that, while the major powers dominate defence industrial cooperation both at the government and at the corporate level, the lesser powers and smaller defence firms follow the trend and participate in the supply chains of large weaponry. Finally, the chapter addresses the question whether cooperation or competition represents the most promising strategy towards a capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. © Oxford University Press 2018.

	abstract = {The European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) are both institutions through which European states can engage in European defence–industrial cooperation. Each organisation embodies a unique set of institutional tools through which to manage issues such as the high and rising costs of defence procurement, technological innovation, defence R&D, standardisation, multinational capability programmes and interoperability. In short, the EU and NATO are institutional tools through which European states can manage the positive effects and negative consequences of defence globalisation. By drawing on an innovative conceptual framework derived from the institutional interaction literature, this article analyses how the EU and NATO interact with one another for defence–industrial issues. In doing so, the article principally aims to provide a conceptually informed analysis of the appeal of each body as a mechanism for defence–industrial cooperation and how each institution affects the other. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The use of offsets is one of the main characteristics of international defence trade. The rising costs of defence equipment and the significant contraction of defence spending have resulted in an environment that favoured the use of offset policies, the latter becoming increasingly demanding in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The chapter analyses the role of offsets on the process of integration of defence equipment markets, with a specific focus on the EU. Particular attention is given to the offset-relevant regulation and practice and to their recent evolution in the EU following the adoption of European Directive on defence and security procurement (81/81/EC). Offsets play a dual role with regard to the integration of defence industries: on one hand they can be trade-distorting and contribute to the survival of inefficient suppliers in arms importing countries; on the other hand, they can contribute in overcoming barriers that may otherwise prevent some potentially efficient suppliers from accessing the supply chains of the big system integrators. The chapter draws the attention on the need to complement the regulatory evolution by further initiatives aiming at improving the access of non-incumbent suppliers to the supply chains of the large defence system integrators. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Four years after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-Russia Council came into being, it represents a picture in ambivalence and incomplete realization of partnership. This monograph focuses on the Russian side of this growing estrangement. It finds the Russian roots of this ambivalence in the increasingly visible manifestations of an autocratic and neo-imperial Russian state and foreign and defense policy. These strong trends in Russian policy inhibit the formation of a genuine security partnership that can provide for Eurasian security in the face of multiple contemporary threats. It is debatable whether Russia really wants a comprehensive partnership with NATO. Its military-political elite still views NATO and the United States in adversarial terms, even though its leadership speaks positively about the value of this partnership. Recent U.S. military initiatives like missile defense or the wars in Kosovo and Iraq are leading Russia to entertain thoughts of withdrawing from many of the existing European arms control treaties. Another cause of estrangement is to be found in that, as Russia regenerates its autocratic imperial model of state building, it aspires to the goal of a free hand in creating an exclusive Eurasian security bloc from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. This effort is incompatible, not only with the democratic choice of many of those peoples, but also with European security as a whole. We can see this, for example, in Moscow's refusal to evacuate the Trans-Dniestrian territory it effectively has annexed from Moldova and its demands for a 20-year base there. Another example is Russia's attempt to block Ukrainian and Georgian efforts to join NATO at some point. Thus the tendency to demand a free hand in creating a kind of exclusive bloc in Eurasia, buttressed by an approach to security which still remains mired in zero-sum categories, precludes Russia's effective integration with NATO and the maximum benefit that could accrue to it from partnership with NATO. Russia's ambition to form an exclusive military-economic bloc with its Commonwealth of Independent States neighbors also inhibits it from fully using the possibilities for partnership with NATO in the economic sphere as it relates to defense industrial cooperation. Although NATO is actively pursuing Russian participation in many projects, Russian officials and firms either cannot or will not make the best use of such opportunities. These problems similarly appear in regard to military operations and exercises. Even though numerous exercises involving NATO and Russian forces take place, the atmosphere remains one of mistrust. Plans for a joint theater missile defense remain just that-plans. Russian military and political leaders express growing concern about Washington's desire to build missile defense bases in Eastern Europe. They dislike the possibilities often discussed in the United States of using nuclear weapons as warfighting weapons, or of using nonnuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles, or of space-based weapons. Leading Russian military men have trouble understanding how it is that NATO still functions, and they are reluctant to participate in NATO peace operations either in Afghanistan or potentially in Iraq. Indeed, Russia is creating its own peacekeeping brigade for such operations. On the one hand, this brigade is supposed to be interoperable with NATO. On the other, it may be earmarked for use in and around Russia's borders. In either case, it is highly unlikely that Russia will acquiesce to its own forces being placed under NATO command and control. If one adds to this geopolitical mistrust and rivalry for influence in and around the former borders of the Soviet Union the absence of either a strong economic basis for East-West cooperation or popular support for it, it becomes clear that the opportunities for partnership are limited intrinsically. Even naval operations to counter terrorism and proliferation on the high seas have now become an issue because NATO wants to conduct exercises in the Black Sea, and Russia is resolutely opposed to any exercise there. Although the naval dimension has been the most productive one for NATO-Russian joint exercises, this dimension of partnership also now is coming under increasing strain and mistrust. Accordingly, we may observe that, in the ambivalent partnership between NATO and Russia, the inhibiting factors consist of both the so-called values gap and the continuing geopolitical rivalry that never fully went away. Russia's demands for a sphere of influence based upon its autocratic form of rule are intrinsic challenges to the Eurasian security order, not just because the success of that project is predicated upon freezing instability in Moldova and the Caucasus. Rather, the real problem is that Russia has neither the resources nor the capacity to formulate adequate and enduring solutions to regional security issues, and its desires are resisted by key players in Ukraine and Georgia. Russia's attempts to impose its preferences, absent genuine democratization, mean that it necessarily will add to the security burdens of the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Eurasia in general, leaving those areas vulnerable to a series of potential threats that Europe and the United States ultimately cannot permit to flourish. As long as the political will to maximize the benefits of partnership-enhanced security, democracy, and prosperity for all of Eurasia-is lacking, this ambivalence will remain and, with it, enduring stresses and tensions between East and West. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This effort is also causing the industry to restructure, with streamlining efforts and consolidation, as businesses shift focus from serving the local market to emerging as leading global companies. The country's Defense Offsets Policy mandates that 30-50% of a contract total be reserved for the domestic aerospace industry. The government expects this effort will help aerospace companies to achieve a new level of industrial competence by expanding basic engineering skills and enabling companies to start delivering value-added products. The policy also permits commercial aviation to be tapped by suppliers to meet offset requirements. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate above 18% and Boeing forecasts delivery of 1,150 commercial aircrafts in the country in the next 20 years.},

This activity is the second of three phases of NMSG Technical Activity Programs (TAP) that began with a feasibility study and will culminate with the implementation phase linked up and harmonized with the NATO Active Layered Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence (ALTBMD) program. The ALTBMD program will be supported by an Integrated Test Bed (ITB) for evaluation and validation purposes. MSG039 should produce results that support the ITB development by acting as a pathfinder for its requirements definition and implementation approach. The Task Group is comprised of members of six NATO nations (FR, NL, NO, TU, UK, US) and the NATO C3 Agency (NC3A) and is chartered to develop and demonstrate an initial simulation architecture for NATO Extended Air Defence C2 Interoperability. Central to the work of the TG is the development of the Federation Object Model (FOM) which is based on the Real-Time Platform Reference Federation Object Model (RPR FOM). The paper will discuss the trade-off between SISO TDL BOM and other methods of 'wrapping' TDL messages, such as STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE). The paper will also present the architecture of the MSG039 federation, which is scheduled for final demonstration in June 2006. The scenario represented in that demonstration will be a hypothetical future threat of different TBMs. The participants of the demonstration include federates representing the US Early Warning satellites, NATO Shared Early Warning (SEW), NATO Air Command and Control System (ACCS), Early Warning Radar systems, land and maritime weapon systems.},
