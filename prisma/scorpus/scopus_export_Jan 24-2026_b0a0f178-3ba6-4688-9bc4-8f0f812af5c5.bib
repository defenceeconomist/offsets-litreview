	abstract = {Singapore is a tiny island state that since independence from the British in 1965 has managed to develop a formidable defence-industrial base. Singapore’s policymakers prefer to use the term defence ‘ecosystem’, as it more aptly captures all the diverse elements contributing to arms production capacity, within and beyond, the industrial base. This is often referred to as technological absorption capability, and includes specialist supply chains, R&D institutions, skilled engineering and design personnel and high technology universities. As part of a conceptualised model highlighting the principal facets in the development of Singapore’s defence-industrial ecosystem, this chapter examines the importance of proactive government strategy, treating the core defence company, ST Engineering, as a strategic industry. Technology development is fostered via indigenous R&D investment, foreign technological partnerships and defence offset. This unique defence-industrial model is framed within the country’s ‘Total Defence’ policy, emphasising the significance of technological development through civil-military integration. Singapore’s defence-industrial eco-system is a success story, and offers the potential for emulation by other emerging states seeking accelerated defence industrialisation. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Keith Hartley and Jean Belin; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {This chapter examines to what extent Europe's governments and defence contractors cooperate to provide European Armed Forces with military capabilities. Defence industrial cooperation has evolved as almost the default policy option for European powers to develop large military platforms. Yet, there is no uniform trend, but large variation across countries (for example, France versus Germany), across sectors (land versus air versus sea), and with regards to the sources of cooperation (for example, government induced versus investment driven). The chapter shows that, while the major powers dominate defence industrial cooperation both at the government and at the corporate level, the lesser powers and smaller defence firms follow the trend and participate in the supply chains of large weaponry. Finally, the chapter addresses the question whether cooperation or competition represents the most promising strategy towards a capable European Defence Technological and Industrial Base. © Oxford University Press 2018.

	abstract = {The European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) are both institutions through which European states can engage in European defence–industrial cooperation. Each organisation embodies a unique set of institutional tools through which to manage issues such as the high and rising costs of defence procurement, technological innovation, defence R&D, standardisation, multinational capability programmes and interoperability. In short, the EU and NATO are institutional tools through which European states can manage the positive effects and negative consequences of defence globalisation. By drawing on an innovative conceptual framework derived from the institutional interaction literature, this article analyses how the EU and NATO interact with one another for defence–industrial issues. In doing so, the article principally aims to provide a conceptually informed analysis of the appeal of each body as a mechanism for defence–industrial cooperation and how each institution affects the other. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The use of offsets is one of the main characteristics of international defence trade. The rising costs of defence equipment and the significant contraction of defence spending have resulted in an environment that favoured the use of offset policies, the latter becoming increasingly demanding in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The chapter analyses the role of offsets on the process of integration of defence equipment markets, with a specific focus on the EU. Particular attention is given to the offset-relevant regulation and practice and to their recent evolution in the EU following the adoption of European Directive on defence and security procurement (81/81/EC). Offsets play a dual role with regard to the integration of defence industries: on one hand they can be trade-distorting and contribute to the survival of inefficient suppliers in arms importing countries; on the other hand, they can contribute in overcoming barriers that may otherwise prevent some potentially efficient suppliers from accessing the supply chains of the big system integrators. The chapter draws the attention on the need to complement the regulatory evolution by further initiatives aiming at improving the access of non-incumbent suppliers to the supply chains of the large defence system integrators. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Four years after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-Russia Council came into being, it represents a picture in ambivalence and incomplete realization of partnership. This monograph focuses on the Russian side of this growing estrangement. It finds the Russian roots of this ambivalence in the increasingly visible manifestations of an autocratic and neo-imperial Russian state and foreign and defense policy. These strong trends in Russian policy inhibit the formation of a genuine security partnership that can provide for Eurasian security in the face of multiple contemporary threats. It is debatable whether Russia really wants a comprehensive partnership with NATO. Its military-political elite still views NATO and the United States in adversarial terms, even though its leadership speaks positively about the value of this partnership. Recent U.S. military initiatives like missile defense or the wars in Kosovo and Iraq are leading Russia to entertain thoughts of withdrawing from many of the existing European arms control treaties. Another cause of estrangement is to be found in that, as Russia regenerates its autocratic imperial model of state building, it aspires to the goal of a free hand in creating an exclusive Eurasian security bloc from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. This effort is incompatible, not only with the democratic choice of many of those peoples, but also with European security as a whole. We can see this, for example, in Moscow's refusal to evacuate the Trans-Dniestrian territory it effectively has annexed from Moldova and its demands for a 20-year base there. Another example is Russia's attempt to block Ukrainian and Georgian efforts to join NATO at some point. Thus the tendency to demand a free hand in creating a kind of exclusive bloc in Eurasia, buttressed by an approach to security which still remains mired in zero-sum categories, precludes Russia's effective integration with NATO and the maximum benefit that could accrue to it from partnership with NATO. Russia's ambition to form an exclusive military-economic bloc with its Commonwealth of Independent States neighbors also inhibits it from fully using the possibilities for partnership with NATO in the economic sphere as it relates to defense industrial cooperation. Although NATO is actively pursuing Russian participation in many projects, Russian officials and firms either cannot or will not make the best use of such opportunities. These problems similarly appear in regard to military operations and exercises. Even though numerous exercises involving NATO and Russian forces take place, the atmosphere remains one of mistrust. Plans for a joint theater missile defense remain just that-plans. Russian military and political leaders express growing concern about Washington's desire to build missile defense bases in Eastern Europe. They dislike the possibilities often discussed in the United States of using nuclear weapons as warfighting weapons, or of using nonnuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles, or of space-based weapons. Leading Russian military men have trouble understanding how it is that NATO still functions, and they are reluctant to participate in NATO peace operations either in Afghanistan or potentially in Iraq. Indeed, Russia is creating its own peacekeeping brigade for such operations. On the one hand, this brigade is supposed to be interoperable with NATO. On the other, it may be earmarked for use in and around Russia's borders. In either case, it is highly unlikely that Russia will acquiesce to its own forces being placed under NATO command and control. If one adds to this geopolitical mistrust and rivalry for influence in and around the former borders of the Soviet Union the absence of either a strong economic basis for East-West cooperation or popular support for it, it becomes clear that the opportunities for partnership are limited intrinsically. Even naval operations to counter terrorism and proliferation on the high seas have now become an issue because NATO wants to conduct exercises in the Black Sea, and Russia is resolutely opposed to any exercise there. Although the naval dimension has been the most productive one for NATO-Russian joint exercises, this dimension of partnership also now is coming under increasing strain and mistrust. Accordingly, we may observe that, in the ambivalent partnership between NATO and Russia, the inhibiting factors consist of both the so-called values gap and the continuing geopolitical rivalry that never fully went away. Russia's demands for a sphere of influence based upon its autocratic form of rule are intrinsic challenges to the Eurasian security order, not just because the success of that project is predicated upon freezing instability in Moldova and the Caucasus. Rather, the real problem is that Russia has neither the resources nor the capacity to formulate adequate and enduring solutions to regional security issues, and its desires are resisted by key players in Ukraine and Georgia. Russia's attempts to impose its preferences, absent genuine democratization, mean that it necessarily will add to the security burdens of the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Eurasia in general, leaving those areas vulnerable to a series of potential threats that Europe and the United States ultimately cannot permit to flourish. As long as the political will to maximize the benefits of partnership-enhanced security, democracy, and prosperity for all of Eurasia-is lacking, this ambivalence will remain and, with it, enduring stresses and tensions between East and West. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This effort is also causing the industry to restructure, with streamlining efforts and consolidation, as businesses shift focus from serving the local market to emerging as leading global companies. The country's Defense Offsets Policy mandates that 30-50% of a contract total be reserved for the domestic aerospace industry. The government expects this effort will help aerospace companies to achieve a new level of industrial competence by expanding basic engineering skills and enabling companies to start delivering value-added products. The policy also permits commercial aviation to be tapped by suppliers to meet offset requirements. The market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate above 18% and Boeing forecasts delivery of 1,150 commercial aircrafts in the country in the next 20 years.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the preliminary results of the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group 039 / Task Group 027 "Modelling and Simulation Support of Extended Air Defence Command and Control Interoperability". This activity is the second of three phases of NMSG Technical Activity Programs (TAP) that began with a feasibility study and will culminate with the implementation phase linked up and harmonized with the NATO Active Layered Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence (ALTBMD) program. The ALTBMD program will be supported by an Integrated Test Bed (ITB) for evaluation and validation purposes. MSG039 should produce results that support the ITB development by acting as a pathfinder for its requirements definition and implementation approach. The Task Group is comprised of members of six NATO nations (FR, NL, NO, TU, UK, US) and the NATO C3 Agency (NC3A) and is chartered to develop and demonstrate an initial simulation architecture for NATO Extended Air Defence C2 Interoperability. Central to the work of the TG is the development of the Federation Object Model (FOM) which is based on the Real-Time Platform Reference Federation Object Model (RPR FOM). The paper will discuss the trade-off between SISO TDL BOM and other methods of 'wrapping' TDL messages, such as STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE). The paper will also present the architecture of the MSG039 federation, which is scheduled for final demonstration in June 2006. The scenario represented in that demonstration will be a hypothetical future threat of different TBMs. The participants of the demonstration include federates representing the US Early Warning satellites, NATO Shared Early Warning (SEW), NATO Air Command and Control System (ACCS), Early Warning Radar systems, land and maritime weapon systems.},
