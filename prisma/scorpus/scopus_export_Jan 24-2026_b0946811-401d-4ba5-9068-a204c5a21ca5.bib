	abstract = {This study examines how Indonesia can advance its Defense Industrialization 5.0 goals by adopting an Enforced Autonomy Model-an approach that treats industrial development not as a market-driven evolution but as a statemandated mission. Through qualitative policy analysis and diagnostic tools like the Ishikawa diagram and Arms Production Ladder, the paper identifies persistent challenges that hinder progress, including fragmented governance, outdated technology, limited R&D investment, and weak integration of local suppliers. These challenges, while well-known, are often addressed through voluntary policies that lack binding force. The Enforced Autonomy Model proposed in this study introduces a shift in perspective: it argues that without enforcement mechanisms-such as presidential-level authority, mandatory local content rules, and structured talent pipelines-Indonesia will remain dependent on foreign suppliers and struggle to meet long-term strategic goals. Drawing lessons from countries like South Korea, Turkey, and Singapore, the paper demonstrates that meaningful transformation in the defense sector requires strong political leadership, clear targets, and institutional accountability. To operationalize this approach, the study outlines six strategic roadmaps covering human capital, production line modernization, supply chain development, product innovation, export promotion, and governance reform. Each roadmap includes enforceable targets tied to legal or regulatory instruments, ensuring alignment across ministries, state-owned enterprises, and research institutions. The findings suggest that by embedding enforcement into national policy, Indonesia can not only achieve the targets set in its 2045 development agenda but also emerge as a key defense supplier for the Global South. In doing so, the country would shift from being a passive participant in global defense markets to a proactive industrial actor capable of innovation, autonomy, and strategic relevance. © (c) 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) encourage coal-dependent emerging economies to phase out coal and transition to renewable energy. However, JETPs face significant obstacles, creating tensions with international economic law. Local content requirements (LCRs) represent a particularly problematic regulatory barrier to energy transitions. This article thus examines whether international economic law expedites or obstructs Asia's energy transition, and whether LCRs are incompatible with international economic law. To answer these questions, this article juxtaposes LCR provisions in JETPs and domestic regulations in two case studies: Indonesia and Vietnam. It then contextualizes LCR costs and benefits before examining tensions with international economic law and potential state defences justifying LCRs. It culminates in suggesting how LCRs could be designed to neutralize such tensions. This article argues that international economic law complements, rather than collides with, energy transition goals and that LCRs are not anathema to international economic law, as long as they are designed and implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. © 2025 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Offsets are agreements or contracts in which the buying country tries to compel the exporting company to reinvest part of the contract value back into the importing country. As defense equipment and systems acquisitions involve large costs for a country, offsets can be a way to balance such costs, improve national technological and industrial development, as well as meet economic and industrial development strategies. However, some countries cannot do this type of contracts, following the European Union Directives, while others continue to use military or defense offsets in a successful way. Lack of effectiveness, efficiency and trust is common in such agreements, dictating a country's loss of wealth and reputation. Therefore, increasing accountability around offset transactions is critical. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of different offset policies by analyzing a sample of failure and success cases. © 2023,Defence S and T Technical Bulletin.

	abstract = {The use of offsets is one of the main characteristics of international defence trade. The rising costs of defence equipment and the significant contraction of defence spending have resulted in an environment that favoured the use of offset policies, the latter becoming increasingly demanding in both quantitative and qualitative terms. The chapter analyses the role of offsets on the process of integration of defence equipment markets, with a specific focus on the EU. Particular attention is given to the offset-relevant regulation and practice and to their recent evolution in the EU following the adoption of European Directive on defence and security procurement (81/81/EC). Offsets play a dual role with regard to the integration of defence industries: on one hand they can be trade-distorting and contribute to the survival of inefficient suppliers in arms importing countries; on the other hand, they can contribute in overcoming barriers that may otherwise prevent some potentially efficient suppliers from accessing the supply chains of the big system integrators. The chapter draws the attention on the need to complement the regulatory evolution by further initiatives aiming at improving the access of non-incumbent suppliers to the supply chains of the large defence system integrators. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},
