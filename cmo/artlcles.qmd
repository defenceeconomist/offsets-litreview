| **Achmadi 2025 - Forced autonomy model for Indonesia** | Indonesia lacked mandatory offset and technology‑transfer clauses; licensed assembly dominated; proposed policy adds technology transfer for deals > USD 50 m and SME certification. | Without binding offset obligations, suppliers have little incentive to transfer know‑how, leaving Indonesian firms as low‑value assemblers; mandatory technology‑transfer clauses and SME integration create incentives for primes to co‑develop and co‑produce locally. | Reliance on licensed assembly remained transactional and did not transform local capability; enforcement of technology transfer is expected to build indigenous production, though excessive regulation may cause bureaucratic overload. | The article argues that Indonesia's offset absence resulted in limited learning; mandatory technology transfer and SME integration (modelled on South Korea and Turkey) could create sustainable collaboration and supply autonomy. |
| **Amara & Pargač 2009 - Czech Gripen ICP** | The Czech Industrial Cooperation Programme (ICP) required at least 20 % direct offsets within a 10‑year Gripen procurement; a multi‑ministry commission oversaw obligations. | A comprehensive contract and multi‑ministry oversight ensured that suppliers integrated Czech SMEs into production chains, aligning offsets with domestic strengths. | After two years, 26 % of obligations were delivered and domestic firms joined the Gripen supply chain; however, complexity and the potential for hidden agendas created transparency challenges. | The ICP shows how coordinated governance and direct offsets can embed SMEs into global programmes, though monitoring is essential to avoid complexity and opportunism. |
| **Anicetti 2024 - EU offsets after Ukraine** | Post‑2022, member states relied on offsets to secure industrial benefits despite EU Directive 2009/81/EC, and exemptions were widely used; the Czech-Slovak CV90 programme was fragmented by separate national offset demands. | National governments pursued offsets to satisfy domestic industries, causing divergence from joint procurement; high offset demands fragmented programmes and incentivised reliance on non‑EU suppliers. | Fragmentation undermined interoperability and standardisation: Czechia and Slovakia abandoned joint procurement and ordered separately with 40 % offsets; offsets also increased non‑EU dependence and reduced transparency. | The study highlights how offset‑driven national priorities can splinter alliance procurement and increase supply‑chain fragmentation, even when a common EU framework exists. |
| **Anicetti 2025 - Persistence of offsets in supply‑driven markets** | After the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, CEE countries prioritised rapid deliveries then resumed offsets through long‑term G2G agreements; early deliveries were turnkey, with later batches requiring local production and MRO. | Governments balanced short‑term readiness with long‑term self‑sufficiency: phased offsets allowed immediate capability while committing suppliers to technology transfer and localisation; strategic G2G frameworks provided leverage over primes. | States resumed offset demands despite supply constraints; this approach shortened supply chains and strengthened local sustainment capacity. | Offsets persisted because they served self‑sufficiency and deterrence goals, demonstrating that phased localisation under G2G deals can align readiness with industrial growth. |
| **Arafia 2020 - Indonesian IDKLO scheme** | Indonesia's trade‑return/local‑content/offset policy requires 85 % of contract value to be compensated, including at least 35 % local content; offsets include technology transfer, training, co‑production and buybacks. | Commodities were bartered for SU‑35 fighters but matching offered goods to Russian demand proved difficult, requiring coordination among ministries and suppliers. | Negotiations stalled and only 10 of 20 proposed commodities were accepted, demonstrating the complexity and delays inherent in countertrade offsets. | The case illustrates that indirect offsets based on barter can hinder procurement timelines and produce limited economic benefit when commodities do not meet supplier needs. |
| **Balakrishnan & Matthews 2009 - Malaysian defence offsets** | Malaysia employed ad‑hoc offsets since the 1990s; the 2005 policy formalised requirements but vendors feared technology leakage, leading to a focus on MRO; local R&D spending remained low. | Prime contractors engaged local firms through co‑production and subcontracting (e.g., SME Aerospace, CTRM) which built capabilities; however, export‑control regulations and high royalties limited technology transfer and disincentivised complex manufacturing. | Some firms integrated into global supply chains (SME Aerospace produces components for Airbus); overall, manufacturing accounted for only ~8 % of offset value and Malaysian industry remained dependent on foreign technology and imported materials. | The experience shows that when offsets prioritise MRO over high‑value manufacturing due to vendor fears, they yield limited strategic benefits; success stories arise from long‑term partnerships and absorptive capacity. |
| **Balakrishnan 2022 - Technology absorption challenges** | Southeast Asian buyers demanded sophisticated technology transfers despite lacking industrial capacity; end‑users were not responsible for managing technology transfer; programme management and quality control were weak【173442651121733†L408-L461】. | Misaligned expectations led buyers to expect step‑by‑step guidance while suppliers waited for requests; inadequate local management and miscommunication caused project failures; export‑control laws (e.g., ITAR) and bureaucratic protectionism hindered cooperation. | Some offset projects failed or required suppliers to establish their own maintenance centres due to poor local performance; overall, unrealistic demands and lack of absorptive capacity prevented effective technology transfer. | The study underscores that offsets cannot compensate for weak institutions and capacity; clear responsibilities, competent management and realistic expectations are prerequisites for successful industrial participation. |
| **Berkok 2005 - Offset multipliers and absorption** | Offsets often require suppliers to match work to local industry using multipliers to value desirable activities; absorption capacity varies across sectors. | When domestic clusters possess strong backward and forward linkages, offsets involving technology transfer and co‑production are easier and less costly; high multipliers, however, encourage investment in low‑absorption sectors and generate costly expansions. | Countries with robust industrial clusters can exploit transferred technologies, whereas high multipliers distort incentives and lead to inefficient investments. | The theoretical analysis highlights that offset effectiveness depends on local industrial maturity and careful multiplier design; transaction costs and matching markets can also erode offset incentives. |
| **Bezuidenhout 2022 - Technology transfer case study** | Defence offset technology‑transfer projects involved different cultures and political interests; success depended on recipient management commitment and planning. | Transparent communication, adequate financial resources and early supply‑chain planning fostered trust between suppliers and recipients; hidden agendas, overconfidence and lack of top‑management commitment hindered knowledge transfer. | Projects with transparency and strong management succeeded in transferring skills; those plagued by hidden motives suffered delays and incomplete technology absorption. | The case study demonstrates that relational and organisational factors often determine offset outcomes more than technical complexity. |
| **Herrara 2008 - Latin American offsets** | Latin American states pursued offsets despite small industrial bases; Brazil's Gripen deal promised 100 % technology transfer and 80 % local production with a deferred counter‑contract. | Suppliers agreed to transfer significant technology and establish local facilities; success relied on local firms' ability to absorb knowledge and scale production. | Outcomes varied: Colombia established an airworthiness department and MRO centres, while overall industrial benefits remained limited due to low skills and small scales. | The study suggests that ambitious direct offsets can catalyse industrial capacity, but only when recipient countries possess sufficient absorptive capacity and scale. |
| **Holden 2020 - South Africa's arms deal** | South Africa's 1999 arms deal included Defence Industrial Participation (DIP) and National Industrial Participation (NIP) schemes; credits could be multiplied through "package deals" and generous interpretations of causality. | Multipliers and upfront credit allocations allowed contractors to claim massive offset credits (up to 192 times the actual investment) by bundling unrelated projects, encouraging minimal real investment. | Projects collapsed or produced little lasting benefit: BAE/Saab secured \$1.7 bn in credits for a \$6.6 m investment and then withdrew; overall, offset impacts were far below credited values. | The South African case illustrates how poorly designed credit systems and weak governance enable rent‑seeking and produce negligible industrial gains despite large nominal offsets. |
| **Ianakiev 2014 - Offsets and EU procurement** | Offsets are controversial in the EU: they can support new suppliers entering system integrators' supply chains but also distort trade; the 2009/81/EC directive requires member states to suppress mandatory offsets except for essential security interests. | By limiting offsets, the EU aims to foster open competition and a European Defence Technological and Industrial Base; offsets may still be used when justified by security needs. | Mandatory offsets are expected to contract; small suppliers might struggle to break into supply chains, but overall cooperation and standardisation should improve. | The directive indicates that legal frameworks can mitigate market distortions created by offsets and encourage pan‑European cooperation. |
| **Jang 2023 - Korean offset reforms** | Korean offset requirements were introduced in 1982 and modified over time; by 2016-2020, offset returns fell sharply, prompting calls for reinforcement and adoption of offset banking. | Offset banking allows credits to be accumulated across contracts and executed over longer periods; a top‑down negotiation strategy and dedicated personnel are proposed to strengthen the system. | Without reforms, Korea experienced reduced offsets and inter‑departmental disputes; proposals aim to restore sustained localisation of R&D labs and MRO centres. | The analysis shows how institutional design-offset banking, long execution windows and strategic negotiation-can revive offset benefits and maintain self‑reliance. |
| **Kanniainen 2017 - Offsets as insurance** | The model treats offsets as an insurance device: national security is strictly convex in the offset transaction, meaning that additional offset activities increase security at an increasing rate. | Offsets reduce the probability of supply disruption and improve security, but the insurance claim is capitalised in the delivery price; buyers thus pay a higher price. | Offsets are not a "free lunch"; they enhance security but increase procurement costs and may not be worthwhile if security gains are small. | This theoretical perspective helps explain why governments tolerate higher costs for offsets that safeguard supply chains. |
| **Lazar 2019 - Gripen offsets in Visegrad countries** | Hungary's offset programme (2001-2015) concentrated investment in already developed regions; the defence industry was largely excluded; the Czech programme adopted broader SME involvement and was led by the MoD. | In Hungary, vague regulations and limited oversight allowed offsets to be channelled into existing firms; in the Czech Republic, stronger governance integrated SMEs into the Gripen supply chain; regional cooperation among Visegrad countries was absent. | The Hungarian programme failed: few jobs were created and some companies went bankrupt, whereas the Czech programme succeeded in building a domestic supply chain and sustaining companies. | The comparison demonstrates that clear planning and inclusive governance are crucial for offsets to deliver durable industrial benefits; lack of oversight leads to regional disparities and failure. |
| **Maharani & Matthews 2023 - Offsets in Indonesia's strategic industries** | Indonesia's informal offset regime (1976-2014) focused on licensed production without guidelines or multipliers; a formal policy and Committee for Defence Industry Policy (KKIP) were introduced in 2012. | The absence of structured policies allowed foreign suppliers to retain control, leaving local firms as low‑value subcontractors; formalisation aimed to synchronise defence production with military needs and increase technology transfer. | Offsets often failed to deliver long‑term benefits; they were anti‑competitive and welfare‑reducing with cost premiums; success depends on recipient absorptive capacity. | The history shows that without clear policies and strong absorptive capacity, offsets provide only short‑term assembly work and limited industrial growth. |
| **Markowski & Hall 2014 - Mandatory offsets** | Mandatory offset schemes require suppliers to meet secondary obligations regardless of cost; these schemes are common but controversial. | Offsets increase contractual incompleteness: secondary requirements are vague and difficult to enforce; suppliers pad prices to recover offset costs and may withdraw if obligations become unprofitable. | Evidence suggests mandatory offsets seldom achieve promised benefits; costs are incurred up‑front, benefits are uncertain and often fail to materialise. | The paper warns that mandatory offset regimes burden buyers with hidden costs and complexity while delivering little in return. |
| **Markowski 1998 - Switzerland's pragmatic offset policy** | Switzerland expects foreign suppliers to place work in Swiss firms equal to 100 % of contract value; direct offsets require participation in the project while indirect offsets involve exports, licensing or R&D. | Offsets are confined to competitive Swiss suppliers; cost premia (~4 % of import value) are accepted because in‑country upgrades and support provide through‑life savings. | The policy maintains domestic know‑how and political support for defence spending; Switzerland sustains its defence industry despite reliance on imports. | The pragmatic approach demonstrates that high reciprocal offsets can coexist with a healthy domestic base if they are targeted, competitive and transparently valued. |
| **Matthews 2020 - European offset regimes** | Many European nations operated prescriptive, penal offset regimes in the 1990s and 2000s, mandating investments and threatening fines; these failed to generate high‑value investment or skilled employment. | The 2009 EU Defence Procurement Directive restricted indirect offsets and allowed direct offsets only when justified by national security; member states dismantled offset frameworks and turned to joint cooperative programmes. | Offsets have declined across Europe and collaborative programmes (Future Combat System, Tempest) have replaced national offset schemes. | The reforms show that supranational regulation can phase out inefficient offset practices and encourage deeper industrial cooperation. |
| **Matthews 2020b - UK Industrial Participation policy** | The UK requires suppliers to propose industrial benefits equal to 100 % of offshore content and evaluates them competitively without multipliers. | Competitive evaluation discourages price padding and emphasises cost‑effective proposals; however, exporters face a dilemma: offering offsets may create future competitors, but refusing offsets can forfeit sales. | The policy has maintained industry participation with limited cost escalation; exporters choose whether to offer technology transfer on a case‑by‑case basis. | The UK example illustrates a balanced approach to offsets that mitigates cost risks while still attracting industrial participation. |
| **Matthews 1991 - Exporters' dilemma** | British defence firms must decide whether to offer offsets when selling abroad; offsets can secure sales but may help create foreign competitors. | Firms often choose to provide technology transfer offsets despite the risk because refusal would lose the sale; governments can either support offsets or risk losing domestic jobs. | Offsets deliver short‑term export success but can erode long‑term competitive advantage if foreign firms learn to compete. | The article highlights the strategic trade‑off faced by exporters in offering offsets. |
| **Matthews & De Vera 2019 - Singapore's defence‑industrial ecosystem** | Singapore negotiates offsets privately without a prescriptive policy; a strong central agency (DSTA) coordinates procurement and industrial participation. | By negotiating case‑by‑case, Singapore secures co‑production and research partnerships that align with national objectives; the Formidable‑class frigate deal included local construction and joint stealth‑technology research. | Singapore successfully built five frigates domestically and acquired advanced technologies; its defence industry is integrated into global supply chains. | The case illustrates that flexible negotiation and centralised coordination can turn offsets into effective long‑term partnerships. |
| **McKinsey 2014 - Managing offset obligations** | Western defence firms face growing offset obligations; mismanagement can lead to legal penalties and reputational damage. | Suppliers offer training, technology transfer and financing to win contracts (e.g., Lockheed's package for Poland, Boeing's training in Saudi Arabia); recipients use offsets to build capabilities and sometimes become competitors. | Offsets can open markets and foster long‑term relationships, but mismanagement risks penalties; some recipients (Embraer, Alenia) developed capabilities and now compete with former mentors. | The report emphasises that strategic planning and compliance are essential to turn offset obligations from contractual burdens into competitive advantages. |
| **Peterson 2011 - Offsets and national interests** | Governments use offsets to reduce costs, save foreign currency, obtain technology and create jobs; however, offsets may displace domestic production and create foreign competitors. | Offsets transfer technology and production abroad to meet political goals; the U.S. government leaves offset decisions to private companies, which may not align with national interests. | Offsets can build allied industrial capabilities but erode the exporter's industrial base and lead to competition; economic benefits are uncertain and often accrue to recipients rather than exporters. | The article underlines the tension between short‑term political gains and long‑term industrial risks in offset policies. |
| **Power 2025 - Economic and political effects of offsets** | Offsets increase contract prices as suppliers pass on investment costs; economic ministries seek large offset packages while defence ministries prioritise price and capability. | Firms adjust prices to recover offset investments; offsets are used sociotropically to legitimise arms purchases and garner public support. | Offsets provide dubious economic gains and raise procurement costs; they may increase public acceptance of defence acquisitions but seldom deliver long‑term development. | The dissertation suggests that political considerations often drive offset demands, while economic benefits remain uncertain. |
| **Santos et al. 2023 - Offsets in reindustrialising countries** | Offsets operate in highly competitive markets prone to corruption and lack of transparency; Portugal's offset programme lacked coordination and clear contracts. | Competitive pressures encourage suppliers and officials to inflate offset packages; without a single negotiating authority, obligations are vague and difficult to enforce; direct offsets suit developed countries, while indirect offsets may be more appropriate for developing ones. | Portuguese offsets failed to achieve industrial goals; suppliers preferred paying fines over fulfilling obligations. | The study emphasises that matching offset type to national capacity and improving governance are essential to prevent corruption and achieve desired outcomes. |
| **Spindel 2024 - Offsets for political leverage** | States pursue offsets to increase political influence rather than economic benefit; technologically advanced countries can leverage direct offsets, while less advanced ones rely on indirect offsets. | Leaders expect offsets to create enduring political ties; direct offsets strengthen states' positions in global arms networks, but indirect offsets leave weaker states dependent and peripheral. | Offsets can solidify political relationships, but they rarely build lasting industrial capacity in countries lacking advanced manufacturing; indirect offsets perpetuate dependency. | The article warns that offsets often serve political signalling rather than economic development, deepening inequalities between core and peripheral states. |
| **Transparency International 2010 - Offsets and corruption** | Offset arrangements receive little scrutiny; due diligence, monitoring and audits are rare. | The complexity of offset contracts and lack of transparency enable corruption; arranging offsets increases contract costs; recommendations include performance monitoring, transparency, dual pricing and due diligence. | Offsets frequently become sites for bribery and misallocation; buyers pay for offsets without clear benefits. | TI's report underscores the need for strong governance and transparency to prevent corruption and ensure offsets deliver value. |
| **Ungaro 2013 - Trends in the defence offset market** | Global offset obligations are rising, with recipient countries increasingly demanding direct offsets centred on technology transfer and long‑term partnerships. | Countries strengthen control and penalties; firms must adapt to growing demands, while shrinking European budgets push companies to seek exports and accept ambitious offset requirements; lack of coordinated European policy leaves companies to manage offsets individually. | Offset demands are expected to increase, potentially eroding European firms' competitiveness and technological edge. | The paper highlights the global shift toward direct, technology‑focused offsets and the strategic implications for suppliers and recipients. |
| **Weiss & Blauberger 2016 - EU Commission and offsets** | The EU Commission launched legal challenges against national offset schemes; many member states modified their rules and began phasing out offsets despite global trends. | Judicial strategies and guidance notes clarified that offsets are incompatible with EU treaty principles unless justified by essential security interests; member states faced infringement proceedings if they persisted. | National offset regimes are declining; standardisation and cross‑border cooperation within the EU have increased as a result. | The study shows that supranational legal action can drive policy convergence and reduce the distortions caused by offsets. |
| **Weiss & Biermann 2019 - EU defence cooperation and offsets** | Smaller EU states initially defended offsets but accepted reforms when major powers offered supply‑chain compensations; offset reduction is seen as a complement to cooperation and strengthening of the EDTIB. | Major powers used compensation to persuade reluctant states to drop offsets; this rebalanced benefits and deepened cooperation. | Offsets are being reduced across Europe, supporting deeper integration and joint industrial projects. | The article illustrates how political bargaining can dismantle offset demands and foster pan‑European industrial collaboration. |
| **Zanotti 2011 - Turkey's offset policy** | Turkey's strategic plan mandates at least a 50 % offset return on procurement deals above USD 10 million and emphasises co‑production and export licences. | The high offset requirement is intended to build self‑reliant defence production, but it conflicts with U.S. export‑control laws and pushes Turkey toward suppliers who are more flexible on technology transfer. | Turkey has achieved some co‑production (e.g., T129 helicopters) but faces strained relations with U.S. suppliers and increased reliance on non‑NATO partners. | The case demonstrates how aggressive offset demands can foster domestic industry but also create diplomatic friction and shift procurement to alternative suppliers. |
| **Brauer & Dunne 2012 - Arms trade and economic development** | Offsets are globally widespread and represent around 40 % of U.S. defence export contracts; they add administrative costs (7-10 %) and often inflate project costs. | Empirical evidence shows that co‑production (e.g., F‑16) increases costs by up to 34 % and causes delays; offsets seldom reduce costs or stimulate broad economic development. | Offsets rarely create jobs or technological benefits; instead, they lead to cost overruns and schedule slippage. | The authors conclude that offsets are poor tools for economic development and call for better data and audits to assess their value. |
| **Butler 2017 - Transatlantic defence procurement** | Offsets are viewed as discriminatory and distortive in the EU; they force arms manufacturers into risky investments and hyper‑specialisation. | Offset obligations may exceed contract value, exposing contractors to financial risk; the EU aims to phase out offsets and promote open competition, while U.S. companies under Foreign Military Sales avoid offsets. | Offsets distort trade flows and rarely deliver job creation or technology transfer; contractors may be on the hook for huge liabilities (e.g., Lockheed Martin's \$27 bn obligations). | The chapter supports eliminating offsets to reduce market distortions and encourages governments to focus on quality and price rather than side deals. |
| **Calcara 2018 - Work‑share politics and cooperation** | European co‑development programmes like the Eurofighter and A400M were shaped by "juste retour", guaranteeing work shares equivalent to national investments. | Work‑share rules politicised production allocation, causing rivalry and inefficiencies; attempts to abandon juste retour (e.g., A400M) still encountered delays because industry sought to preserve national benefits. | Programmes suffered cost overruns and schedule slippage; fragmentation persisted. | The article implies that offset‑like work‑share practices can hamper cooperation and suggests that flexible allocation mechanisms might improve efficiency. |
| **Calcara 2019 - Liberal‑intergovernmentalist view** | Defence firms publicly call for EU‑level cooperation but maintain close ties with home governments to secure offsets, subsidies and protection. | Firms fear supply‑chain disruption and competition; thus they lobby governments to preserve protective measures even while supporting integration rhetorically. | Offsets persist as a tool for industrial protection, hindering full market integration. | The piece shows that industrial actors themselves can perpetuate offset regimes to safeguard domestic advantages. |
