In practice, this means a portion of the contract value must be reinvested into the buyer's economy - for example through local production, technology transfer, or other projects - so that some of the spending \"flows back\" domestically [@brauer_arms_2004]. Offsets became a prominent feature of the global arms trade after the Cold War, as shrinking defence budgets and rising weapon costs pushed exporting firms to sweeten deals and importing states to demand local benefits [@brauer_arms_2004]. Today, offsets (also called *industrial cooperation* or *compensation* agreements) are **widespread** - by some estimates involving 5-30% of world trade in various forms [@brauer_arms_2004] - with around 130 countries insisting on offsets for military purchases [@jang_trends_2023].\n\nOffsets serve multiple purposes. For buyer governments, they help **justify large defence expenditures** by promising economic returns (jobs, investments, technology) to the domestic economy [@brauer_arms_2004, @dehoff_defense_2014]. This is often politically \"seductive\" - a way to \"double-dip\" by getting the arms *and* keeping public funds working at home [@brauer_arms_2004]. For sellers, although offsets can be seen as a costly *\"pay-to-play\"* requirement [@dehoff_defense_2014], they have become a **competitive tool**: in close international tenders, a generous offset package can be the deciding factor in winning the contract [@dehoff_defense_2014]. Indeed, governments sometimes value the proposed offsets *as highly as* or even more than the price and capability of the weapon itself [@dehoff_defense_2014].\n\nYet, offsets remain controversial. Economists argue that offsets distort normal trade and are rarely cost-effective, especially when mandated broadly [@brauer_arms_2004]. There are concerns that the **true costs** of offsets (often hidden as price mark-ups or inefficiencies) outweigh the benefits, amounting to a \"free lunch\" illusion for the buyer [@brauer_arms_2004]. Moreover, because of their complexity and opacity, offset deals can create **corruption risks**, providing levers for kickbacks or political favoritism if not transparently managed [@magahy_defence_2010]. A World Trade Organization agreement even forbids offsets in civil procurement except for national security exceptions, underscoring that they are considered distortive in open trade [@brauer_arms_2004]. Despite these concerns, defence offsets have persisted and evolved in the post-1990 era. The following sections present a **typology of offset regimes** and a survey of major country cases, before concluding with a comparative summary table.\n\n## Typology of Defence Offset Regimes\n\nOffsets can be classified along several key dimensions. Below is a typology of defence offset regimes, highlighting how different countries or contracts may approach these arrangements:\n\n### Mandatory vs. Voluntary Offsets\n\n**Mandatory offsets** are those formally required by the purchasing government, often by law or policy, as a fixed condition (e.g. *\"at least 50% of the contract value must be offset\"*). In such cases, foreign suppliers **must** agree to specified offset obligations to secure the deal. For example, Poland's offset law around 2003 required contractors to invest an amount equal to **100% of the fighter jet contract's value** back into Poland's economy [@seguin_why_2008]. Many countries - especially emerging arms importers - adopted mandatory offset policies in the 1990s and 2000s to maximize local benefits. However, analysts like Hall and Markowski argue that **across-the-board mandatory offsets tend to cause trade distortions and inefficiencies**, effectively a tax on the purchase [@brauer_arms_2004]. Empirical studies find that such imposed offsets seldom deliver net economic gains and can raise procurement costs [@brauer_arms_2004].\n\nBy contrast, **voluntary offsets** are negotiated case-by-case and not universally required - they arise from suppliers offering side-deals or governments striking bargains, but without a blanket mandate. If offsets are *voluntarily agreed* (for instance, as part of a competitive bid), they **might avoid some welfare loss** since they can be tailored to mutually beneficial projects [@brauer_arms_2004]. Voluntary offsets are common in deals where the buyer has no formal offset law but expects some industrial cooperation; for example, the UK or Australia often pursue industrial participation **informally** in major purchases without an official percentage target. In practice, the line can blur: even with formal policies, many offsets are negotiated in detail, and major arms exporters will frequently *volunteer* attractive offset packages as a competitive **\"sweetener\"** to win contracts \\[brauer_arms_2004\\]. The 2003 Polish fighter competition illustrates this - Lockheed Martin clinched the deal by proposing an unprecedented \\\\\\$9+ billion offset package (far above the contract's value) with dozens of projects, tipping the scales in its favor [@dehoff_defense_2014].\n\nOverall, the trend since 1990 has been toward **mandated offsets** in most large arms-importing countries, despite efficiency concerns [@brauer_arms_2004]. Even so, some highly advanced buyers (e.g. Australia, discussed later) have moved away from strict mandates, preferring flexible or *\"best value\"* approaches to domestic industry involvement rather than rigid offset quotas.\n\n### Direct vs. Indirect Offsets\n\nOffsets are also categorized as **direct** or **indirect**. **Direct offsets** refer to compensation activities that are **directly related to the defence product** being purchased (@dehoff_defense_2014\\]. These typically include things like co-production of the weapon system, licensed manufacturing of parts, maintenance and overhaul work, or technology transfer for the specific platform. For instance, if a country buys fighter jets, a direct offset could be the local assembly of some aircraft components or the joint production of missiles for those jets. India, for example, restricts offsets to *defence-relevant* activities only - meaning the foreign vendor must plow back investment or work into India's defence, aerospace, or internal security sectors (such as sourcing sub-systems from Indian firms or partnering with local defence manufacturers) [@spear_2013].\n\n**Indirect offsets** are benefits or projects **unrelated to the purchased system**, which can be either in the defence realm broadly or completely outside it[@magahy_defence_2010]. These might include the foreign supplier investing in the buyer's civil sectors, launching joint ventures in unrelated industries, or fulfilling certain general trade and investment obligations. For example, a Russian sale of Su-30 fighters to Malaysia was tied to an offset where Sukhoi helped Malaysia's civilian space agency with technology transfer - a *civilian* project offsetting a **military** purchase [@dehoff_defense_2014]. Classic indirect offsets in past deals have ranged from building petrochemical plants, to purchasing commodities, to setting up vocational training centers in the buying country [@magahy_defence_2010]. Indirect offsets can also be *defence-indirect* (e.g. investing in a different defence program or sector than the purchased item) or *civilian*. In Saudi Arabia's 1985 **Al-Yamamah** arms deal, for instance, the UK supplier (BAE Systems) agreed to develop a local **sugar refinery and a pharmaceutical plant** as part of the offset, which had no direct link to the Tornado aircraft being sold [@magahy_defence_2010].\n\nOver the years, **indirect offsets have grown in scope**, especially as countries use defence purchases to drive broader economic goals. In fact, as one survey notes, offsets evolved from straightforward military co-production in earlier decades to more creative arrangements: *defence-to-civil* offsets (military contracts fulfilled by investing in civil sectors), then even **civil-to-civil** offsets, and lately \"*civil-to-defense*\" deals (where, say, a commercial aircraft sale might require investment in the buyer's defence industry)[@brauer_arms_2004]. Many offset programs now allow a mix of direct and indirect credits, sometimes with **multipliers** to favor certain activities (for example, a country might give extra credit - say 2x value - for investments in high-priority sectors like cybersecurity or indigenous R&D)[@spear_2013; @dehoff_defense_2014]. The balance between direct and indirect offsets often reflects a country's priorities: those focused on **building a domestic defence base** prefer direct offsets, whereas those emphasizing **general economic development or political gains** may welcome indirect projects in infrastructure, education, or other industries.\n\n### Formal vs. Informal Regimes\n\nThis dimension distinguishes how **institutionalized** a country's offset practices are. A **formal offset regime** means the government has explicit policies, legislation, or dedicated agencies to manage offsets. These regimes have published guidelines on offset requirements (minimum percentage, eligible activities, penalty for non-performance, etc.) and a bureaucracy to negotiate and enforce offset contracts. **India** is a good example: since 2005 it has a formal Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) with an **\"Offset Clause\"** (initially 30% of deals over ₹300 crore) and an \"Defence Offset Management Wing\" to oversee implementation[@spear_2013]. The **United Arab Emirates** likewise established the UAE Offsets Group (now *Tawazun Economic Council*) back in 1992 specifically to handle and channel offset investments. Formal regimes often make offsets **mandatory by rule** (as discussed earlier) and integrate them into the defence procurement cycle.\n\nIn contrast, **informal offset arrangements** occur in countries without a codified offset policy but where offsets still play a role on a **case-by-case basis**. These tend to be states that are either major arms producers themselves or have strategic procurement relationships. For instance, the **United Kingdom** historically had no general offset law requiring all foreign purchases to include offsets - however, in practice the UK government often negotiated industrial participation or technology sharing when buying abroad (especially for high-value projects). A recent example is Britain's purchase of P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft from the US: while not bound by an offset policy, the deal was accompanied by commitments from Boeing to invest in UK aerospace infrastructure, effectively an *informal* offset to secure domestic benefits. Similarly, **Australia** explicitly *eschews \"classic\" offsets* - a 2016 policy statement affirmed Australia \"does not have a policy of offsets\" - instead using an Australian Industry Capability (AIC) program to encourage local content through contract incentives rather than fixed quotas. These informal approaches try to avoid the cost inflation associated with mandated offsets, yet still achieve some local industry involvement.\n\nIn summary, formal regimes provide clear rules but can become bureaucratic, whereas informal approaches offer flexibility but rely on ad hoc bargaining power. Notably, since 2010 the **European Union** has pushed members toward more informal/limited use of offsets: EU Directive 2009/81 on defence procurement required states to **remove mandatory offset requirements** from their laws (offsets are largely seen as protectionist under EU single-market principles) [@ianakiev_defence_2014]. EU countries can still seek domestic industry benefits, but now usually justify them case-by-case under national security exceptions (Article 346 TFEU) or via soft mechanisms like requiring a certain portion of subcontracts to involve local firms [@ianakiev_defence_2014]. This represents a shift from formal offset regimes to more constrained or *\"hidden\"* offsets in Europe.\n\n### Buyer-Driven vs. Supplier-Driven Offsets\n\nAnother way to categorize offsets is by **who initiates or drives the offset agreement**. In **buyer-driven** offsets, the purchasing country's government is in the driver's seat: it demands specific offset commitments as a condition of the tender or purchase. Most mandatory offset regimes are inherently buyer-driven - the state lays out offset requirements in the RFP (Request for Proposal) and each bidder must respond with an acceptable offset plan. For example, when **South Korea** held its F-X III fighter competition in 2013, it explicitly weighted the evaluation such that **17% of the score** was based on the **offset and tech-transfer proposals**, slightly more than the weight given to price [@dehoff_defense_2014]. This shows the buyer using offsets as a **scoring criterion** and leverage to extract technology. Buyer-driven offsets typically align with the importer's strategic goals, but if pushed too far (demanding extremely high offsets), they risk deterring bidders or inflating costs.\n\nIn **supplier-driven** offsets, the impetus comes from the selling side - the contractor or exporting country offers an offset package to make their bid more attractive, even if not strictly required. As global arms markets grew more competitive post-Cold War, Western defense firms began viewing creative offset offers as a **\"competitive weapon\"** rather than just a contractual burden [@dehoff_defense_2014]. In bids to Brazil, India, and others, vendors often voluntarily pledged local partnerships, production lines, or investments to outmaneuver rivals. The Poland F-16 deal mentioned earlier is a prime example: Lockheed Martin's **supplier-driven generosity** (with 100+ projects across Polish industry) set a new benchmark, forcing competitors to try to match such offers [@dehoff_defense_2014]. Supplier-driven offsets can also occur outside formal competitions - for instance, a company might approach a country with a proposal to sell a platform *along with* setting up a local maintenance facility or funding a technology center, enticing the buyer to consider the deal. This approach often reflects the exporter's strategic interest in establishing a long-term foothold in the country. As one McKinsey analysis noted, while some contractors long saw offsets as a necessary evil, many now recognize **offset deals can cement lasting market access and relationships** in foreign markets [@dehoff_defense_2014].\n\nIn practice, most offset deals involve **elements of both**: the buyer sets expectations, and suppliers tailor their offset bids to exceed those expectations or address the buyer's unique interests. It's a negotiated process. Nonetheless, understanding who has the upper hand matters. Wealthy Gulf states, for example, often dictate offset terms (buyer-driven) given the allure of their contracts, whereas smaller buyers might rely on what sellers are willing to bring to the table. Finally, the **political context** can influence this dynamic - if a sale is geopolitically important to the seller's government, the seller may proactively offer generous offsets (supplier-driven) to secure influence or alliance favor (making this also a foreign policy tool).\n\n### Industrial vs. Strategic Orientation\n\nCountries also differ in whether they view offsets primarily as an **industrial-economic tool** or as a **strategic security tool** (or both). An **industrial-oriented offset regime** is one where the offsets are designed to spur economic development, commercial partnerships, and technological know-how in the civilian economy or general industrial base. The aims here include job creation, export promotion, diversification away from raw resource dependence, and general capacity-building. Many oil-rich states pursued offsets with an industrialization motive: **Saudi Arabia's** Economic Offset Program explicitly sought to use defence deals to kick-start high-tech and manufacturing sectors, create skilled employment for Saudis, and move toward a knowledge-based economy. Offsets in such regimes often go into **dual-use or civilian projects** (as seen with Saudi's offsets generating businesses like polymer chemical plants and engineering services and are evaluated by their economic return more than military value). **Malaysia** and **Indonesia** likewise leveraged defence purchases to gain investments in areas like aerospace, shipbuilding, or even agriculture - using offsets as a form of industrial policy.\n\nIn contrast, a **strategic-oriented offset regime** focuses on offsets as a means to achieve military or geopolitical objectives: building a *strategic* defence industry for self-reliance, acquiring sensitive technologies that bolster autonomy, or strengthening alliances and influence. **India's** offset policy is a clear example - its primary goal is to attain greater self-reliance in arms production and high-end defence R&D, reducing dependence on foreign suppliers. Thus India insists on **direct defence offsets only**, aiming for technology transfers and indigenous production that enhance its strategic capabilities. Similarly, countries like **South Korea**, **Taiwan**, **Turkey**, and **Israel** have historically seen offsets (or related co-production programs) as a way to localize defense production and develop *strategically critical technologies* (from fighter jets to missiles) that would allow them to deter adversaries or be less vulnerable to foreign embargoes. Offsets here blur with pure military collaborations; for instance, Turkey joined the U.S.-led F-35 Joint Strike Fighter development - an arrangement not termed an offset per se, but motivated by the same strategic offset logic of tech gain and industrial involvement.\n\n\"Strategic\" can also imply **political leverage**: some offset deals are driven by the buyer's intent to use the arms contract to gain broader political support or tie the supplier into a long-term partnership. For example, offset joint ventures can create constituencies within the supplier country that have a stake in the relationship (as seen when Boeing's offset ventures in Saudi Arabia led to deeper business ties and continued arms sales). In that sense, offsets can serve as a form of **strategic diplomacy**, aligning the supplier's interests with the buyer's stability and development. However, offsets used for strategic aims can come with **risks**: advanced technology transfers are often tightly controlled (the U.S., for instance, has sometimes refused or delayed certain offsets that would give away crown-jewel tech, leading to friction with buyers like South Korea [@jang_trends_2023], and offset projects in sensitive sectors can become entangled in security and intellectual property disputes [@tradegov2020].\n\nIn summary, **industrial vs. strategic** orientation highlights the predominant lens through which a country justifies its offset program. In practice most regimes combine both - seeking industrial development that underpins strategic autonomy. But the emphasis can shift. For instance, **Brazil** pursued offsets with a mix of both aims: its 2014 Gripen fighter deal included deep technology transfer (strategic gain for its air force) while also partnering with local aerospace industry (industrial growth). On the other hand, **South Africa's** late-1990s offset-driven arms procurement was sold mainly on economic-industrial grounds (promised jobs and investment), with less strategic rationale given the post-apartheid security environment - an approach that later drew criticism when the economic benefits failed to materialize as hoped.\n\nHaving outlined the typological dimensions, we now turn to **country-level case studies** of major defence offset regimes since 1990. These illustrate how different nations have implemented offsets, their policy evolution, goals, mechanisms, outcomes, and challenges.\n\n## Country Case Studies of Offset Regimes\n\n### India\n\n**Timeline and Policy Evolution:** India had experiences with *de facto* offsets (licensed production of foreign arms) since the 1960s, but only established a formal offset policy in **2005** as part of its Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP)[\\[59\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=India%20is%20keen%20to%20ensure,a%2050%20per%20cent%20offset). The 2005 policy mandated at least **30% offsets** for any defence import contract above ₹300 crore (about \\\\\\$50-60 million)[\\[35\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=the%201960s%20in%20forms%20such,a%2050%20per%20cent%20offset). This was a response to India's surging arms imports and desire to leverage that buying power for indigenous industry growth[\\[60\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=Offset%20Policy)[\\[61\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=,sectors%20like%20civil%20aerospace%2C%20and). Over time, the policy was refined: *offset \"routes\"* were defined to include direct purchase of Indian defence goods, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Indian defence firms or R&D, and later even technology transfers with multiplier credits[\\[62\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=1,multiplier%20available%20on%20them%20and). Revisions in 2008-2011 expanded the scope slightly (allowing offsets in related areas like internal security, civil aerospace and training) but India has **consistently restricted offsets to defence and aerospace sectors**, i.e. **only direct or defence-related indirect offsets** are counted[\\[26\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=Reflecting%20her%20strategic%20interests%2C%20India,Three%20offset%20routes%20are%20available)[\\[62\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=1,multiplier%20available%20on%20them%20and). The DPP has been updated almost every 2-3 years, tweaking offset guidelines (e.g. introducing **offset banking** to allow credits from one contract to be applied to future obligations[\\[63\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=The%20initial%20DPP%20has%20been,for%20up%20to%20seven%20years)). A major change came in **2020**: under a new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP 2020), India **diluted its offset requirements** by exempting many deals - specifically **government-to-government agreements, intergovernmental deals, and single-vendor contracts - from offset obligations**[\\[64\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=Henceforth%2C%20the%20offset%20clause%20will,of%20the%20defence%20offset%20policy)[\\[65\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=,offset%20load%20extra%20cost%20in). Since most big-ticket purchases (like Rafale fighters from France) fell under these categories, this effectively rolls back the offset mandate for those cases, in an effort to reduce procurement costs and address the poor performance of offsets so far[\\[66\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=also%20in%20response%20to%20a,report%20on%20the%20same%20issue)[\\[67\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=,agreement%20due%20to%20the%20offset). Critics argue this move virtually \"scraps\" the offset policy and gives up a key opportunity for tech transfer[\\[64\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=Henceforth%2C%20the%20offset%20clause%20will,of%20the%20defence%20offset%20policy)[\\[68\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=supplier%20deal%20,to%20acquire%20scarce%20advanced%20technology), while the government cited a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report showing underachievement of past offsets.\n\n**Aims:** India's offsets are principally aimed at **developing an indigenous defence industrial base and technological self-reliance**[\\[52\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=,civil%20aerospace%2C%20and%20internal%20security%E2%80%9D). The official objectives are to foster internationally competitive enterprises in India, boost defence R&D and manufacturing capability, and spur co-development of new technologies[\\[52\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=,civil%20aerospace%2C%20and%20internal%20security%E2%80%9D). Strategically, India wants to become less dependent on foreign arms; offsets were seen as a way to obtain advanced know-how (e.g. aircraft avionics, radar, missile tech) and to integrate Indian companies into global supply chains. There is also an economic aim: using defence imports as a catalyst for high-tech jobs, exports, and skill development (aligning with India's broader \"Make in India\" initiative). Notably, India **prohibited pure indirect civilian offsets**, reflecting that the priority was **military-relevant industry** growth, not general trade deals[\\[26\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=Reflecting%20her%20strategic%20interests%2C%20India,Three%20offset%20routes%20are%20available). Offsets also serve a political purpose: they help justify to the public and parliament why India is spending billions on foreign weapons - by showing that part of that money is reinvested domestically (addressing the long-standing pressure to achieve defence indigenization)[\\[7\\]](@brauer_arms_2004%20#:~:text=seductive%20for%20politicians%2C%20especially%20in,Moreover%2C%20since%20arms).\n\n**Mechanisms:** Under India's regime, foreign vendors fulfill offsets via several mechanisms. A primary mode is **co-production or purchase of sub-systems**: the foreign company agrees to source components, assemblies, or services from Indian manufacturers (Indian Offset Partners, IOPs) for the main platform[\\[62\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=1,multiplier%20available%20on%20them%20and). For example, if India buys helicopters, the supplier might place contracts with Indian firms to produce avionics or engine parts worth 30% of the deal. Another mechanism is **direct investment and joint ventures** in India's defence sector - foreign OEMs can earn offset credits by investing in Indian companies or forming JV partnerships to produce weapon systems locally[\\[62\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=1,multiplier%20available%20on%20them%20and). Technology transfer was added as an eligible mechanism in 2012, with a bonus multiplier (up to 3x credit for high-value tech) to incentivize genuine knowledge transfer[\\[69\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=development%2C%20joint%20ventures%20and%20co,expanded%20beyond%20just%20defence%20R%26D). India also allows offsets via funding **R&D projects** in approved institutions[\\[70\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=on%20them%20and%3B%203,expanded%20beyond%20just%20defence%20R%26D). Initially, India did not allow **offset banking**, but later iterations permitted vendors to bank offset credits (for up to 7 years) for future use[\\[63\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=The%20initial%20DPP%20has%20been,for%20up%20to%20seven%20years). Offset agreements in India are typically complex and involve years of implementation, with the Ministry of Defence monitoring annual progress and imposing penalties (up to 5-10% of contract value) for shortfalls. In practice, foreign firms often partner with a web of Indian small and medium enterprises to discharge obligations, given limitations of any single local firm to absorb huge contracts[\\[71\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=The%20offsets%20policy%20has%20nevertheless,capacity%20for%20significant%20defence%20offsets).\n\n**Outcomes and Challenges:** India's offset program has had **mixed results**. On one hand, it did stimulate some local industry growth: an aerospace manufacturing ecosystem around Bangalore benefited from offset-related work, contributing to a dramatic rise in India's aerospace exports from a mere \\\\\\$62 million in 2005 to about **\\\\\\$6.7 billion by 2014**[\\[72\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=offset%20partners.%20,a%20major%20domestic%20aerospace%20firm). This suggests offsets helped Indian firms integrate into global supply chains (e.g. producing aircraft parts for major OEMs) and made India one of the top 10 exporters in that segment[\\[73\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=micro%2C%20small%20and%20medium%20enterprises,a%20major%20domestic%20aerospace%20firm). On the other hand, multiple audits and studies have been scathing about the effectiveness of Indian offsets. A CAG audit of 2007-2013 offset contracts found **significant non-compliance** - 5 of 16 contracts examined did not meet policy conditions, with offsets accepted that provided **no real value-add to Indian partners** (essentially paper transactions)[\\[74\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=First%2C%20according%20to%20the%20audit%2C,of%20the%20Indian%20offsets%20policy)[\\[75\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=2007%20and%202011%20five%20of,of%20the%20Indian%20offsets%20policy). Enforcement was lax: the MoD often failed to levy penalties on defaulters[\\[76\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=Overall%20the%20audit%20found%20that,two%20particular%20issues%20stand%20out). By 2020, out of ₹66,000 crore (≈\\\\\\$9.3B) in signed offset obligations, only **8% (₹5,500 crore)** had been realized, and crucially \"not a single case\" of high-tech transfer was achieved according to the CAG[\\[77\\]](https://www.drishtiias.com/daily-news-editorials/dilution-of-offset-policy#:~:text=,government%20or%20an%20ab). These are sobering figures. Foreign vendors sometimes struggled to find qualified Indian partners or projects, leading to offsets being fulfilled via low-tech or indirect means (like simple purchase of services) that didn't build new capability[\\[78\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=The%20offsets%20policy%20has%20nevertheless,capacity%20for%20significant%20defence%20offsets)[\\[74\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=First%2C%20according%20to%20the%20audit%2C,of%20the%20Indian%20offsets%20policy). There have also been **corruption concerns**: though not always directly tied to offsets, India's defence deals (e.g. AgustaWestland helicopters, or the offset partner selection in the Rafale deal) have faced allegations that offset partner choices or agreements were influenced by cronyism. The opacity and complexity of offset contracts can provide cover for such dealings, a risk highlighted by transparency advocates[\\[15\\]](@magahy_defence_2010#:~:text=alleging%20inefficiency%3B%20high%20costs%2C%20typically,This%20paper)[\\[16\\]](@magahy_defence_2010#:~:text=present%20encompass%20corruption%20risks%20that,In%20the).\n\n**Context:** India's case underscores the challenge of implementing offsets in a bureaucracy-heavy environment with relatively nascent industry. The country's pressing security needs (importing modern arms to counter China/Pakistan) gave it **buyer leverage**, but also urgency that sometimes led the government to waive or water down offsets (as seen in 2020) to avoid delays. Indian industry's **absorptive capacity** constraints have been a recurring theme - many Indian companies simply were not technologically ready to absorb cutting-edge production, limiting the impact of offsets[\\[78\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=The%20offsets%20policy%20has%20nevertheless,capacity%20for%20significant%20defence%20offsets). Still, the policy did catalyze the entry of India's private sector into defence production and encouraged joint ventures (e.g. Tata, Mahindra, L&T teaming with global firms). The recent dilution of offset requirements suggests a strategic re-think: New Delhi may now be focusing more on **direct indigenous development programs** and higher FDI limits in defence, rather than relying on the offset clause, which had not met expectations. The India case demonstrates both the **potential** (billions of dollars in domestic work generated) and **pitfalls** (bureaucratic hurdles, lack of high-tech transfer, compliance issues) of a large mandatory offset regime.\n\n### Saudi Arabia\n\n**Timeline and Policy:** Saudi Arabia was one of the early adopters of formal offsets in the Middle East. Its **Economic Offset Program (EOP)** was launched in the mid-1980s (around **1984-85**) amid major arms deals like the UK's Al-Yamamah agreement[\\[79\\]](https://pasei.com/saudi-vision-2030-arms-imports-military-industrialization/#:~:text=,defense%20contracts%20in%20industrial)[\\[80\\]](@magahy_defence_2010#:~:text=UK%20and%20Saudi%20Arabia%20The,The). The program set a requirement that foreign defense contractors invest a portion of the contract value in Saudi joint ventures and projects. Initially the offset obligation was on the order of **30%**, later standardized to **\\~35% of the contract's value** (specifically the value of the technical equipment/services) to be reinvested in Saudi Arabia[\\[50\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=investment%20in%20skilled%20job,origin%20products%20in%20their%20work). Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Saudi Arabia continued to include offset clauses in most large purchases (from U.S. AWACS and Peace Shield systems to European fighter jets). The EOP was managed by a dedicated committee that evaluated and approved offset projects. By the 2010s, offsets became part of the broader economic strategy: Saudi Arabia's **Vision 2030**, announced in 2016, explicitly aims to localize over 50% of defence procurement spending by 2030, effectively using offsets and localization requirements to build a domestic military-industrial sector. There have been **reforms** to streamline and expand offset guidelines - for example, coordination with the UAE was discussed to allow joint offset projects in either country counting toward obligations[\\[81\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=difference%20between%20the%20U,the%20offset%20program%20is%20to). In recent years, Saudi offset policy has been complemented by direct government investment in defence industry (e.g. the creation of *SAMI*, the Saudi Arabian Military Industries state company, in 2017), but offsets remain a key tool to force foreign suppliers into local partnerships.\n\n**Primary Aims:** Saudi Arabia's offset regime has been *industrial-economic* in nature with a strategic tinge. The government's goal was to leverage massive defence spending to **diversify the economy** and create **skilled employment** for Saudis, reducing over-reliance on oil[\\[49\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Heavy%20investment%20in%20defence%20procurement,no%20such%20product%20is%20available). Offsets were seen as a way to acquire technology and know-how by piggybacking on defence deals - building industries in areas like aerospace, electronics, communications, and other high-tech fields that the Kingdom lacked. An official objective was to become a *knowledge-driven economy*, so offsets extended into training and education initiatives as well[\\[82\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Heavy%20investment%20in%20defence%20procurement,origin)[\\[54\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia,packages%20to%20the%20Saudi%20government). Strategically, Saudi Arabia did not seek full self-sufficiency in arms (it remains heavily import-dependent), but having some local production and maintenance capability was intended to improve security of supply and perhaps give the Kingdom **political leverage** (e.g. local ventures tie Western firms and by extension their governments closer to Saudi security interests). Another aim, especially in recent years, is **local content** - ensuring that a portion of the value of contracts \"stays\" in Saudi, stimulating domestic suppliers and contractors (much like an economic offset for the huge outflow of funds on imports).\n\n**Mechanisms:** The Saudi EOP primarily uses **joint ventures (JVs)** as the mechanism for offsets[\\[50\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=investment%20in%20skilled%20job,origin%20products%20in%20their%20work). Foreign defense companies are required to invest in new Saudi-incorporated ventures (often partnering with local investors or institutions) in designated sectors. These JVs might produce defense-related products (like parts, munitions, or spares), or non-defense goods that help diversify the industrial base. The offset rules also emphasize **local content in subcontracting** - foreign primes and even their subcontractors must give preference to Saudi suppliers where possible[\\[83\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=that%20successful%20bidders%20invest%20the,origin%20products%20in%20their%20work). Over the years, dozens of ventures were created: examples include aircraft maintenance centers, a glycols chemical plant, advanced materials factories, and training academies. In one notable offset project, Boeing in 1985 set up the Boeing Industrial Technology Group to fulfill Peace Shield radar system offset obligations, which engaged in technology training and later partnerships in Saudi education[\\[54\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia,packages%20to%20the%20Saudi%20government)[\\[84\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=offset%20obligations%20in%20relation%20to,packages%20to%20the%20Saudi%20government). The **British Offset Office**, a UK-Saudi joint body, helped channel offsets from UK contracts into ventures like a polymer production plant (Synthomer Middle East, founded 1996 through an offset JV)[\\[51\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=British%20Offset%2C%20a%20joint%20initiative,manufacturing%20and%20bulk%20storage%20capacity). Indirect offsets in civil sectors have also been allowed - such as investments in petrochemicals, telecom, or power infrastructure - as long as they create high-tech jobs for Saudis. To encourage compliance, Saudi Arabia built in penalties and also the incentive of follow-on contracts: companies that successfully established local presence via offsets often gained favor in subsequent deals (e.g. Boeing's deepened ties after its offset group led to further fighter sales)[\\[54\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Saudi%20Arabia,packages%20to%20the%20Saudi%20government). Recent policy has looked to coordinate offsets with other Gulf countries (like the UAE) and focus on projects aligned with national priorities (e.g. localization of ammo production, drone technology, etc.)[\\[81\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=difference%20between%20the%20U,the%20offset%20program%20is%20to).\n\n**Outcomes and Evaluation:** Saudi Arabia's offset program has yielded a **mixed but notable legacy**. By 2006, the EOP had facilitated the creation of **36 companies with total capitalization of \\\\\\$4.5 billion**, and by the mid-2010s over 40 joint ventures were in place[\\[85\\]](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/new-brand-new-name-uaes-offset-programme#:~:text=Tawazun%20Economic%20Council%20was%20established,than%2040%20joint%20venture%20organizations)[\\[86\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=While%20the%20scale%20of%20the,for%20every%20%241bn%20of%20contracts). These ventures spanned sectors from aerospace (e.g. Alsalam Aircraft Company for aircraft maintenance) to food processing (oddly, a dairy farm was once an offset project) and helped employ around **6,500 Saudi nationals by 2006**[\\[87\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=While%20the%20scale%20of%20the,for%20every%20%241bn%20of%20contracts). However, relative to the scale of Saudi defence spending, these achievements were modest - between 1985 and 2006 Saudi spent an estimated \\\\\\$150 billion on arms, which *should* have produced \\\\\\$45-55 billion in offsets if the 30-35% rule was fully enforced, yet only \\\\\\$4.5 billion materialized as offset capital[\\[88\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=36%20companies%20had%20been%20established,for%20every%20%241bn%20of%20contracts)[\\[89\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=total%20military%20capital%20expenditure%20of,for%20every%20%241bn%20of%20contracts). This implies many offsets were waived, delayed or under-delivered (a common issue where suppliers negotiate down actual obligations). The **effectiveness** of offsets in truly diversifying the economy has been **uneven**. Some success stories exist: for example, the **Advanced Electronics Company (AEC)**, founded via offset in 1988 with US help, grew into a leading local defense electronics firm. But many other offset companies struggled once the initial obligation was met - a study noted that offset-founded firms often remained narrow in scope, doing contract manufacturing only for the specific offset and failing to become competitive beyond that[\\[90\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=According%20to%20A,%E2%80%9D). In other words, a company set up to assemble one subsystem under offset might not innovate or win other business after the original offset contract ends[\\[91\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=According%20to%20A,segments%20after%20fulfilling%20its%20offset). Recognizing this, consultants like A.T. Kearney have advised Saudi to incentivize more sustainable ventures and ensure local partners invest in long-term capability, possibly by structuring JVs so that the foreign firm can eventually exit after transferring know-how[\\[92\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=offset%20programme%20reaches%20its%20full,%E2%80%9D)[\\[93\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Such%20incentives%20include%20support%20for,place%20simultaneously%20in%20Saudi%20Arabia).\n\nStrategically, Saudi offsets have not (yet) created an autonomous arms industry for front-line equipment - the Kingdom still imports virtually all major platforms. But it has gained capacity in maintenance, overhaul and some production of less complex items (armored vehicles, ammunition, UAVs with foreign help, etc.). By the late 2010s, Saudi Arabia was cited as **the world's largest offsets market**, forecast to account for \\~15% of global military offset obligations, reflecting the sheer volume of its arms imports and offset demands[\\[94\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,for%20Saudi%20Arabia%2C%20told%20OBG). The Saudi government has become more assertive that future deals must involve **localization** - for instance, recent purchases of naval ships and aircraft include conditions for local assembly or partnership with SAMI. One could say offsets laid the groundwork for the current push toward defence industrialization under Vision 2030.\n\n**Corruption and Governance:** Saudi offset dealings, particularly the Al-Yamamah program with BAE, became infamous for corruption allegations. Investigations in the UK in the 2000s suggested that some payments labeled as \"offset services\" were actually bribes to Saudi officials, leading to a major scandal (though the UK's Serious Fraud Office ultimately dropped the case after political pressure). This underscores a vulnerability: the opacity of offset projects (like a gratuitous investment in a unrelated venture) can be used to cloak illicit commissions[\\[95\\]](@magahy_defence_2010#:~:text=agreements,paper%20offers%20an%20analysis%20of). Saudi Arabia has since implemented more compliance measures and hired consultancies to audit offset performance, but transparency remains low by international standards. The **political economy** of offsets in the Kingdom meant that often members of the royal family or well-connected businessmen were stakeholders in the JV companies created, raising questions about who truly benefited. Nonetheless, some analysts argue the offset program did produce *positive externalities* by exposing local businesses to international partners and raising standards, if not as much as hoped[\\[86\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=While%20the%20scale%20of%20the,for%20every%20%241bn%20of%20contracts)[\\[53\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Beyond%20the%20borders%20of%20Saudi,develop%20their%20own%20defence%20industries).\n\nIn summary, Saudi Arabia's offset regime illustrates a long-term, well-funded attempt to trade petrodollars for industrial development. It has had partial success in building supporting industries and is now being ramped up into an even more ambitious localization drive. But it also highlights classic offset challenges: under-delivery relative to promises, difficulty in sustaining ventures post-obligation, and potential misuse. The Kingdom is now coupling offsets with stronger state-led investment to try to realize its defence industrial dreams.\n\n### United Arab Emirates (UAE)\n\n**Timeline and Policy:** The UAE, like Saudi, established its offset program in the early 1990s. In **1992**, under the guidance of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (then Chief of Staff, now President), the UAE founded the **UAE Offsets Group (UOG)** to manage offset projects[\\[96\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=In%201992%2C%20the%20UAE%20created,TEP%29)[\\[85\\]](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/new-brand-new-name-uaes-offset-programme#:~:text=Tawazun%20Economic%20Council%20was%20established,than%2040%20joint%20venture%20organizations). The program was formally known as the **Tawazun Economic Program** (Tawazun meaning \"balance\" in Arabic). Initially, the UAE mandated that foreign defense suppliers reinvest a substantial portion (commonly **60%** of the contract value) into profitable projects in the Emirates. This high percentage was notable - one of the most demanding globally. Over the years, the UOG facilitated numerous joint ventures and investments. In **2007**, the program was rebranded: UOG became the **Tawazun Economic Council** in a 20th anniversary revamp[\\[97\\]](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/new-brand-new-name-uaes-offset-programme#:~:text=June%2010%2C%202012)[\\[36\\]](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/new-brand-new-name-uaes-offset-programme#:~:text=The%20UAE%20offset%20programme%20bureau,celebrate%20the%20organization%27s%2020th%20anniversary), signaling continuity but a fresh image. In **2015**, the UAE updated its offset policy guidelines, and again in **2019**, issuing a revised policy that broadened the scope of offsets and adjusted mechanisms[\\[98\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=The%20UAE%20introduced%20offsets%20in,projects%20in%20strategic%20industries%20including). The **2019 Tawazun Guidelines** introduced more flexibility in project selection (including non-defense \"strategic sectors\") and set default timelines for offset project completion (typically 7 years)[\\[99\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=The%20UAE%20introduced%20offsets%20in,projects%20in%20strategic%20industries%20including)[\\[100\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=). Today, the Tawazun Council remains a central player in UAE defense procurement, integrating offsets with the country's national economic and technology goals.\n\n**Objectives:** The UAE's offset program is explicitly tied to its national development strategy. Key aims include: **economic diversification**, moving beyond oil by building up industries such as aerospace, precision manufacturing, technology and renewables[\\[101\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=In%201992%2C%20the%20UAE%20created,diversification%20in%20the%20UAE%20by); **developing a local defence sector** for greater self-reliance and high-value exports[\\[102\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=and%20Policy%20Guidelines,diversification%20in%20the%20UAE%20by); **creating a knowledge-based economy** with skilled employment for UAE citizens (Emiratization of the workforce)[\\[103\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=,employment%20opportunities%20for%20UAE%20citizens)[\\[104\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=for%20joint%20projects%20established%20in,difficulties%20finding%20enough%20qualified%20Emiratis); and addressing strategic priorities like food and water security, sustainability, and infrastructure via offset investment[\\[105\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=broadens%20the%20scope%20of%20projects,projects%20in%20strategic%20industries%20including). In short, the UAE sees offsets as a tool to **align defence spending with broader economic and strategic imperatives**. For example, offsets have been directed into setting up aerospace manufacturing (to support both defence and civil aviation) and into dual-use technologies that can spin off civilian benefits. This reflects both **industrial aims** (jobs, local companies) and **strategic aims** (having domestic capability in critical areas and securing foreign partnerships). Another implicit aim is to integrate the UAE into global high-tech supply chains, enhancing its international profile (the UAE wants to be known not just as an arms buyer but as a producer and innovator in certain niches).\n\n**Mechanisms:** The Tawazun Economic Program requires any defense contract over a certain threshold to incur an offset obligation (commonly 60% of contract value historically, adjusted in new guidelines). Foreign contractors fulfill this by proposing **offset projects** which are vetted and approved by Tawazun Council. Mechanisms include: establishing **joint ventures** with local partners (the foreign company invests capital or technology, a local entity contributes some capital/effort, and a new company is formed in the UAE); making **direct investments** (e.g. building a new factory or R&D center); or executing specific **capability development programs** (such as training Emiratis, creating internship programs, or transferring know-how to local institutions). Credits are awarded based on the **value added** in the UAE - and the 2019 policy introduced a credit *multipliers* system to incentivize projects in priority sectors (like a project in advanced technology or one that strongly integrates Emirati employees might earn extra credit)[\\[105\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=broadens%20the%20scope%20of%20projects,projects%20in%20strategic%20industries%20including)[\\[106\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=2,level%20of%20cooperation%20and%20coordination). The program also uses an **\"offset bank\"** concept: companies can undertake projects even when not immediately required, banking credits for future obligations, which encourages continuous engagement. Tawazun operates by reviewing concept papers from contractors, approving viable projects, and then monitoring implementation over multi-year periods[\\[107\\]](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/new-brand-new-name-uaes-offset-programme#:~:text=New%20brand%20and%20a%20new,to%20facilitate%20joint%20ventures). If obligations are not met in time, **penalties** or \"buy-outs\" apply (firms must pay money in lieu of unfulfilled offsets).\n\nOver nearly three decades, the UAE's offsets have created a number of prominent companies: **Abu Dhabi Ship Building** (originally an offset with CMN of France), **NIMR Automotive** (building military vehicles, started via offset), **Caracal International** (small arms manufacturer), and more recently the conglomerate **EDGE Group** (formed in 2019 by consolidating 25 local defense/tech firms, many of which had offset origins). Tawazun also invested in non-defense sectors, such as banking (an offset led to the creation of an Islamic bank in the 1990s) and real estate, but the modern focus is more on strategic industries. Uniquely, the UAE also allowed **regional cooperation**: in 2019, officials from UAE and Saudi discussed that a foreign firm could get offset credit in both countries for a single joint project established in one - aiming to attract bigger projects that benefit the broader region[\\[81\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=difference%20between%20the%20U,the%20offset%20program%20is%20to).\n\n**Outcomes:** The UAE's offset program is often cited as one of the more successful, albeit backed by the country's strong finances and governance. By 2012, the Tawazun Council reported that it had attracted **over 40 joint ventures** through offsets since inception[\\[85\\]](https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/new-brand-new-name-uaes-offset-programme#:~:text=Tawazun%20Economic%20Council%20was%20established,than%2040%20joint%20venture%20organizations). These ventures have contributed to the UAE now having a fledgling but growing defense manufacturing base. For example, the UAE can produce armored vehicles (NIMR), guided munitions, naval vessels (through Abu Dhabi Ship Building), and firearms - things that in 1990 it had zero capability for. The program has also undeniably created high-skilled jobs for Emiratis, though exact figures are not publicly disclosed. One measure of outcome: **export generation** - some offset-born companies are exporting abroad (EDGE's subsidiary AL Tariq sells guided bombs, for instance). The 2019 broadening of offsets to areas like food security and education technology[\\[105\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=broadens%20the%20scope%20of%20projects,projects%20in%20strategic%20industries%20including) suggests the UAE sees enough capacity in pure defense that offsets can now also help other strategic sectors.\n\nChallenges remain, however. **Technology transfer** is still sometimes limited by foreign licensing (U.S. export controls have prevented some advanced tech transfers the UAE wanted[\\[108\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=1,There%20could%20be%20a)). Ensuring **intellectual property ownership** in joint projects can be tricky (foreign partners may be wary of giving up IP)[\\[109\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=do%20not%20allow%20companies%20to,Programs%20%E2%80%93%20Many%20other%20countries). Additionally, **finding qualified local talent** (engineers, technicians) to employ in high-tech offset projects is an ongoing challenge in the UAE[\\[104\\]](https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/uae-defense-sector-opportunities#:~:text=for%20joint%20projects%20established%20in,difficulties%20finding%20enough%20qualified%20Emiratis), given its small population and skills gap - leading to heavy reliance on expatriates, which partially defeats the purpose of knowledge localization. To mitigate this, offsets often include training and education components for citizens. The UAE's drive to become a regional defense hub (exemplified by hosting the big IDEX and Dubai Airshow events) is bolstered by offsets, but ultimately the **commercial viability** of offset companies is a test: some ventures have thrived, others have shuttered once offset credits were earned. The UAE tends to mitigate this by government support or by folding companies into larger groups like EDGE for efficiency. Transparency is moderate - foreign companies have generally praised the UAE's offset process as *businesslike*, but details of projects are not always disclosed due to strategic and commercial secrecy.\n\nIn conclusion, the UAE offset regime shows how a country can methodically harness defence trade for wider development goals. With high-level backing and continuous policy refinement, it has arguably achieved a \"balance\" (true to its name) between defence and economic interests better than many others. As the UAE moves forward, offsets will likely remain central to its plans to domesticate 50%+ of its defense procurement and to cultivate home-grown defense champions.\n\n### Turkey (Turkiye)\n\n**Policy Evolution:** Turkey has pursued defence industrialization since the 1970s, and offsets have been a cornerstone of that strategy. By the late **1980s**, Turkey instituted a formal offset policy for foreign arms purchases, motivated in part by a U.S. arms embargo in 1975 that exposed its vulnerability. A landmark was the **F-16 Peace Onyx** program (initiated 1984) where Turkey co-produced F-16 fighters with U.S. assistance - essentially a direct offset deal that led to the creation of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI)[\\[110\\]](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/tu-f-16.htm#:~:text=Most%20of%20Turkey%27s%20240%20Lockheed,In%20September). Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Turkey mandated offsets (often *minimum 50%* of contract value) on major buys like tanks, helicopters, and missiles. The Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (SSM, now Presidency of Defence Industries) managed these programs. In the 2000s, Turkey shifted from just license production to requiring more technology transfer and local development in offsets - e.g. insisting on source code access for software, or local assembly of complex systems (like the F-15 and F-35 component production). Turkey's offset approach blurred into its **co-development ventures**: e.g. Turkey partnered on the **F-35 JSF** not simply to buy the jet but to be a manufacturing partner (with Turkish firms producing parts of every F-35)[\\[53\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Beyond%20the%20borders%20of%20Saudi,develop%20their%20own%20defence%20industries). This is effectively an offset outcome achieved by joining a multinational program. As of the 2010s, Turkey's policy evolved to **\"Industrial Participation/Co-production\"** requirements in all big contracts, with flexibility in how companies meet them. More recently, as Turkey's own industry has grown, it has less need for traditional offsets when importing (since it imports less and often prefers local products), and in fact Turkey itself as an **exporter** now offers offsets to its customers (for example, offering Pakistan technology share in drone sales). Still, for high-tech acquisitions like long-range air defense or engines that Turkey still needs from abroad, it continues to demand localized production and tech sharing.\n\n**Aims:** Turkey's offset and localization efforts have been driven by a strong quest for **strategic autonomy**. The overarching aim is to develop a robust national defence industry capable of designing and producing a wide range of military hardware - so that Turkey can reduce or eliminate reliance on foreign suppliers (especially crucial after events like arms embargoes or strained relations with allies). Offsets were a means to *import knowledge and manufacturing skills*. The **industrial aim** is also significant: building up indigenous companies (Aselsan in electronics, Roketsan in missiles, TAI in aerospace, etc.), creating jobs for Turkish engineers and technicians, and eventually turning Turkey into a defence **exporter**. Indeed, Turkey often cites South Korea and Israel as models - using offsets to climb the tech ladder[\\[53\\]](https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/reports/saudi-arabia/2015-report/economy/positive-impact-the-offset-programme-brings-multiple-benefits-to-local-firms#:~:text=Beyond%20the%20borders%20of%20Saudi,develop%20their%20own%20defence%20industries). A secondary political aim was to leverage its large orders to ensure alliance support - e.g. by involving American and European companies in local ventures, Turkey increased its interdependence with those allies.\n\n**Mechanisms:** Turkey employed a comprehensive set of offset mechanisms, mostly on the **direct offset** side. These include: **Licensed production** - Turkey produced under license American systems like F-16s, German submarines, etc., gaining production skills; **Technology transfer and co-development** - foreign firms were pressed to share designs and set up R&D collaboration (for instance, Turkey's MILGEM warship program had foreign advisors but local design input); **Local content requirements** - big projects mandated a certain % of parts sourced from Turkish subcontractors or final assembly in Turkey. Turkey also used **offset credits for civilian exports**: a foreign vendor could discharge offset obligations by helping Turkish industry export goods abroad (reverse purchases). Over time, Turkey became savvy in negotiating **high-value work packages**: e.g. as part of an order for utility helicopters, it negotiated setting up a local helicopter assembly line and manufacturing of specific components that could be exported to other customers by the Turkish plant. Another mechanism was **training and know-how**: foreign partners trained Turkish engineers, and many Turkish engineers were embedded in foreign factories to learn (particularly during F-16 and later programs). The SSM/SSB tracked offset fulfillment closely, and Turkey often structured deals so that final payments depended on offset fulfillment (to enforce compliance). The country also set up **defence industrial zones** to host joint production (like TAI's facility in Ankara).\n\n**Outcomes:** Turkey's use of offsets and insistence on local production has been regarded as a relative **success story**. From near-total dependence on imports in the 1980s, Turkey by the 2020s could produce many of its own arms: tactical drones (Bayraktar TB2, Anka), trainer jets (Hurkus), a forthcoming 5th-gen fighter prototype (TF-X), warships, tanks (the Altay, albeit with foreign engine issues), and a range of electronics and missile systems. This transformation was fueled by the technology and industrial capabilities gained through decades of offsets and partnerships. For example, TAI building F-16s gave it the expertise to later develop indigenous aircraft structures; joint projects with European missile makers contributed to Turkey's own missile programs. Turkey's defence exports topped \\\\\\$3 billion annually by the early 2020s, making it a notable arms exporter - something virtually unthinkable before. Offsets also embedded Turkey's firms in global supply chains (TAI and Roketsan supplied parts to the F-35 program until Turkey's suspension in 2019, and numerous Turkish companies are suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, etc., partly thanks to offset-induced certifications). Domestically, tens of thousands of jobs in Turkey's defence sector can be traced back to industrial participation projects that started under offsets since the 1990s.\n\nHowever, not all has been smooth. **Challenges** included occasional disputes over technology (for instance, the U.S. has sometimes refused source code transfers or the sharing of specific sensitive tech which Turkey requested as part of offsets). Also, Turkey's ambition sometimes outpaced what offsets delivered - e.g. having license-produced F-16s did not mean Turkey could design a jet engine; true self-reliance in certain subsystems (like engines, radar) still required additional investment and time. There have been cases where offset projects failed commercially when protected domestic orders dried up. Additionally, after Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, it was removed from the F-35 program - a setback that shows limits of relying on an offset partnership as a guarantee (geopolitics can intervene). But Turkey responded by doubling down on its own development.\n\nOverall, Turkey leveraged offsets in a very strategic manner, using them as stepping stones to an indigenous industry. The country is now close to fielding an entirely home-produced suite of defence products. It demonstrates that with political will, a clear vision, and a relatively large domestic market to leverage (Turkey's armed forces), offsets can indeed contribute to genuine industrial and strategic gains. Turkey's case is often contrasted with others where offsets stayed at assembly-level work; Turkey managed to climb the value chain significantly.\n\n### South Korea\n\n**Policy Background:** South Korea has long pursued local production of foreign weapons under license (dating back to the 1970s), but formal offsets became prominent in the **1990s** as Korea made major high-tech acquisitions. Seoul's approach, like Turkey's, was motivated by the desire to build a domestic defence industry under the umbrella of the U.S.-ROK alliance. By the early 1990s, South Korea instituted an **offset requirement** for foreign defense contracts (often around **30-50%** of contract value). For example, during Korea's F-X fighter competitions (F-15K in 2002, F-35 later), the government explicitly scored bids on their offset proposals, and bidders offered substantial tech transfer and co-production. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), formed in 2006, oversees offsets as part of its acquisition strategy. In recent years, South Korea's stance on offsets has fluctuated: after a 2018 audit that pointed out some inefficiencies, there was internal debate about scrapping mandatory offsets[\\[111\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=Reasons%20for%20this%20rapid%20decline,countries%20worldwide%20as%20preconditions%20to). Indeed, from **2014 onwards**, Korea appeared to reduce its offset demands, especially on purchases from the U.S. via Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs, to avoid delaying deals or due to U.S. reluctance[\\[112\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=Over%20the%20five%20years%20from,reap%20from%202011%20to%202015). South Korea even briefly suspended its legal requirement in some cases, focusing more on direct commercial partnerships. However, as Korean industry now aspires to be a top global arms exporter, there are calls to **reinforce offsets again** to ensure any imports still contribute to local industry[\\[113\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=production%2C%20and%20small%20and%20medium,SMEs%29%20exports)[\\[114\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=For%20Korea%20to%20achieve%20its,must%20be%20expanded%2C%20and%20the). So Korea's offset policy is in a dynamic state - historically crucial, then eased off, and possibly to be strengthened in a targeted way.\n\n**Aims:** The aims of Korean offsets were dual: *industrial development* and *strategic defense capability*. On the industrial side, South Korea saw offsets as a way to acquire advanced manufacturing techniques and integrate its chaebol (conglomerates) into the aerospace and defense supply chains. This was part of the broader economic strategy of climbing the tech ladder (the same model Korea used in electronics and automotive - learn from foreign partners then indigenize). On the strategic side, the goal was to eventually produce most of the weaponry needed to equip Korean forces, giving Seoul more autonomy especially vis-à-vis North Korea's threat. This included being able to export arms for economic and diplomatic benefit. Another implicit aim was to ensure **technology transfer** that could spill over into civilian high-tech sectors (e.g. aerospace know-how benefitting commercial aviation or space programs). Offsets also helped justify large defense purchases politically: the Korean public could accept multi-billion deals if they were told it would result in factories and jobs in Korea and reduce dependency on U.S. support over time.\n\n**Mechanisms:** South Korea's offsets heavily emphasized **technology transfer, local production, and licensed manufacturing**. During the KF-16 program in the mid-90s (Korea's localization of F-16s), Lockheed Martin provided technical data and kits for Samsung Aerospace (now KAI) to assemble 72 of the 140 F-16s in Korea - a direct offset that established jet production capability. Korea also negotiated offsets like **production of parts for export**: e.g. as part of E-737 AWACS aircraft purchase from Boeing, Korean firms got contracts to produce aerospace components for Boeing's civil aircraft, fulfilling offset obligations through *reverse exports*. Often, offsets were tied to specific **technology packages** - foreign suppliers had to train Korean engineers or help set up R&D labs. One prominent example: the FX-II fighter (F-15K) deal in 2002 included transfer of aerospace manufacturing techniques and even cooperation to help Korea develop its own supersonic trainer (which became the T-50 Golden Eagle). Another mechanism was the **Korean Industry Participation** requirement: foreign contractors had to subcontract a percentage of work to Korean defense companies. South Korea also adeptly used **competitive leverage** - in open competitions (like for helicopters in 2013), it made offset offers a major factor, effectively compelling bidders to outbid each other in tech transfer.\n\nBy the 2010s, South Korea had acquired enough domestic base that it sometimes opted to forgo offsets on off-the-shelf buys in favor of speed (for instance, it bought some P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft from the U.S. without significant offsets because it urgently needed them). But concurrently, it launched big **indigenous projects** (KF-X fighter, K2 tank, etc.) often seeded by knowledge gained from prior offset collaborations.\n\n**Outcomes:** South Korea is frequently cited as an **offset success**, similar to Turkey. It has achieved substantial self-reliance: today, Korean-made equipment (from submarines to howitzers to aircraft) forms a large share of its military inventory. Offsets in the 90s and 00s directly contributed to building companies like **Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI)** and **Hanwha Defense** (formerly Daewoo, Samsung tech divisions) into globally competitive players. For instance, the development of the **T-50 advanced trainer jet** - the first supersonic aircraft built by South Korea - was made possible by technology and expertise accumulated from licensed F-16 production and offsets from F-15K deals. Similarly, Samsung Techwin's production of K9 Thunder howitzers benefitted from tech-sharing when buying foreign artillery. Korea's approach of requiring foreign suppliers to purchase Korean-made subcomponents as offsets also helped its SMEs enter international supply chains. By 2020, South Korea's defense exports boomed (selling aircraft to Southeast Asia, tanks to Europe, howitzers to many countries, etc.), approaching the top tier of global arms exporters[\\[6\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=by%20the%20governments%20of%20nearly,SMEs%29%20exports). This remarkable rise (nearly \\\\\\$3-4B in annual exports) is rooted partly in offset-driven capacity-building.\n\nHowever, Korea's offset story also has cautionary notes. The **2018 audit** by Korea's Board of Audit and Inspection found that some offsets were not delivering desired results - noting that while offsets yielded nearly \\\\\\$8 billion in benefits from 2011-2015, they dropped to only \\\\\\$800 million from 2016-2020 as policies shifted[\\[112\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=Over%20the%20five%20years%20from,reap%20from%202011%20to%202015)[\\[111\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=Reasons%20for%20this%20rapid%20decline,countries%20worldwide%20as%20preconditions%20to). The decline was due to multiple factors: reluctance to strain US relations by demanding offsets in FMS deals (like for the F-35), and internal disagreements on how aggressive to be[\\[111\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=Reasons%20for%20this%20rapid%20decline,countries%20worldwide%20as%20preconditions%20to). This indicates that as South Korea became an American security partner of greater importance, it sometimes chose strategic alliance considerations over maximizing offsets (essentially **supplier pressure** in this case: the US views excessive offsets as a trade barrier[\\[115\\]](https://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=e&Seq_Code=192020#:~:text=US%20Identifies%20S,foreign%20defense%20technology%20through)). The recommendation now from Korean experts is that Korea shouldn't abandon offsets entirely if it wants to be one of the top defense exporters - rather it should maintain a smart offset policy to continue upgrading its capabilities[\\[113\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=production%2C%20and%20small%20and%20medium,SMEs%29%20exports)[\\[114\\]](@jang_trends_2023#:~:text=For%20Korea%20to%20achieve%20its,must%20be%20expanded%2C%20and%20the).\n\nAnother challenge is **saturation**: as Korean industry matures, simply assembling foreign designs brings diminishing returns - Korea now seeks true co-development (as with the KF-X fighter with some help from Lockheed). There have been some disappointments, like technology that was promised but not delivered due to export restrictions (e.g. the US reportedly denied transfer of certain F-35 technologies Korea hoped to receive, forcing Korea to develop them domestically). In sum, though, South Korea's use of offsets and local content requirements unquestionably accelerated its journey from an arms importer to an emerging arms exporter. It shows how offsets, aligned with a national strategy and backed by consistent investment in education and infrastructure, can pay off.\n\n### Western Countries: NATO & EU Members, Canada, Australia\n\nMost Western developed countries are arms **exporters** and thus don't usually impose offsets as buyers (since they rarely import major systems they can't produce). However, many **medium-sized Western nations** that do import have had offset policies, and even the major powers have practiced forms of industrial benefits in special cases.\n\nIn **Europe**, during the Cold War and 1990s, it was common for countries to require offsets on big purchases. For example, **Greece** and **Portugal** in the 1990s-2000s had offset requirements upward of 100% for fighter and submarine deals - which unfortunately became notorious for corruption. A **Transparency International** study highlights that Greece's and Portugal's offset programs in that era were marred by bribery scandals (e.g. the German submarine sale to Portugal in 2004 involved massive offsets but also later corruption trials)[\\[116\\]](@magahy_defence_2010#:~:text=4%20CASE%20STUDIES%2026%20Transparency,transparency%20and%20corruption%20in%20defence). These cases show the risk when governance is weak: officials can be swayed to accept inflated offset deals in exchange for kickbacks, with little actual benefit to the economy. **Central and Eastern European** countries, upon joining NATO in the 2000s, also employed offsets to help their struggling industries adapt. **Poland's** 2003 law, as noted, mandated 100% offsets for the \\\\\\$3.5B F-16 deal[\\[18\\]](@seguin_why_2008#:~:text=,the%20two%20remaining%20teams). Lockheed's fulfillment of this (through offset projects like manufacturing aircraft parts, developing an IT park, etc.) was initially hailed as a win[\\[11\\]](@dehoff_defense_2014#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20Western%20defense,4%204). Poland credits the F-16 offsets with injecting new technology and export opportunities - Polish defense suppliers became part of Lockheed's global supply chain, and some civilian projects (like an aviation training center) were launched. However, an assessment a decade later found not all promised investments fully materialized and some jobs were short-lived. After the EU Directive 2009/81/EC, Poland and others had to phase out the formal offset mandate[\\[41\\]](@ianakiev_defence_2014#:~:text=of%20the%20Treaty%2C%20the%20Directive,new%20legal%20framework%20equally%20rules), but they still negotiate industrial cooperation for each deal (Poland's recent purchases of Patriot missiles and F-35s included significant local workshare, though not termed \"offsets\" officially).\n\nMajor NATO countries like **the UK, France, Germany** rarely use the term \"offset\", but they ensure domestic industry involvement via other means. For example, the **British** when buying the American **F-35** became a Tier-1 development partner, securing significant production work for UK industry (British companies build \\~15% of each F-35) - effectively an industrial benefit arrangement akin to offsets, but structured as partnership. **France** almost always buys domestically or jointly develops (so offsets as such don't apply since they favor domestic procurement). **Germany** similarly often co-develops (e.g. with European partners) or, if buying off-the-shelf, might request some final assembly domestically (as it did for some UAV imports). **Italy** and **Spain** have used offsets when buying from the US - for instance, Italy's C-130J purchase in early 2000s had an offset involving Italian firms making subassemblies for Lockheed.\n\nThe EU's crackdown on formal offsets means that since 2010, any **EU member's defence ministry** can't explicitly make offset a tender award criterion (except under national security exception)[\\[42\\]](@ianakiev_defence_2014#:~:text=Directive%2C%20its%20introduction%20will%20have,presence%20of%20the%20Directive%20will)[\\[41\\]](@ianakiev_defence_2014#:~:text=of%20the%20Treaty%2C%20the%20Directive,new%20legal%20framework%20equally%20rules). Instead, they use terms like \"industrial return\" or require bidders to include a plan for local involvement (subject to separate negotiation). Despite this, informal offsets persist in Europe - especially with non-EU suppliers. For example, **Finland** and **Switzerland** (not EU, but Western) demanded heavy offsets for their fighter jet buys in the 1990s. Even in 2021, Finland's \\\\\\$9B F-35 purchase included industrial cooperation commitments (like engine maintenance facility in Finland) though Finland avoided calling it offsets due to EU rules.\n\n**Canada** has one of the oldest offset regimes among Western nations, known historically as **Industrial & Regional Benefits (IRB)**. Since **1986**, Canada required that any major defence procurement from foreign suppliers results in investments in Canada equal to the contract value (100% offset)[\\[117\\]](https://natoassociation.ca/a-made-in-canada-defence-industrial-policy-the-industrial-and-technological-benefits-policy/#:~:text=A%20Made%20in%20Canada%20Defence,2014%2C%20which%20required%20defence). This was partly to appease domestic politics - ensuring all regions of Canada got economic spin-offs from big purchases (for instance, the CF-18 fighter buy in the 1980s brought aerospace work to multiple provinces). In 2014, Canada revamped IRB into the **Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB)** policy[\\[118\\]](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/19833.asp#:~:text=...%20www.wd,IRB%29%20Policy). The ITB policy still mandates 100% economic benefit, but now puts emphasis on priority areas and a \"value proposition\" where bidders are graded on how their proposal will provide long-term technological benefit to Canada[\\[119\\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2017/04/the_industrial_andtechnologicalbenefitspolicy.html#:~:text=Originally%20known%20as%20the%20Industrial,Policy%20was%20launched). The **outcomes** have been significant in sustaining Canada's aerospace industry: companies like Magellan and CAE grew through offset-related subcontracts (making components for Airbus, Boeing, etc., as a result of past offset obligations). However, critics note that many IRB projects were essentially **indirect offsets** (investments in auto parts or other industries) that did not build a self-sufficient defence industry. Canada still relies on imports for most major systems, but it has carved a niche in training simulators, avionics, and space tech, thanks in part to past offsets. Notably, Canada's policy is very formal and transparent - companies regularly report their Canadian content and investments, and there are even cases of companies *over-performing* (exceeding offset requirements) to win favor for future deals[\\[120\\]](https://www.emergingtechnologies.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Canadian-ITB-Guide_HP-June-2022-Windsor.pdf#:~:text=,Ensures%20that%20defence%20equipment).\n\n**Australia** historically did not use the term offsets as mentioned, but in earlier decades it had an \"Australian Industry Involvement\" policy for defence. In the 2000s, it shifted to the **AIC (Australian Industry Capability)** framework, requiring bidders to outline how they will include Australian suppliers. The government does not set a fixed percentage, but major projects like the **F-35, P-8, and naval ship builds** have seen substantial local work content (e.g. Australia locally builds parts of the F-35 and will build most of its new frigates domestically). The Australian stance is that strict offsets add cost premiums of 5-20%, which they want to avoid[\\[40\\]](https://parbery.com.au/making-it-stick-overcoming-the-impediments-to-delivering-on-defences-australian-industry-capability-aspirations/#:~:text=,such%20arrangements%20in%20favour), but at the same time they invest heavily in domestic capability through other means (like teaming arrangements and direct subsidies to industry).\n\nIn summary, Western countries' experience with offsets is varied: **some smaller nations** that are net importers have used them to support their economies (with mixed success), whereas **larger defence producers** focus more on partnership and co-development. Many Western governments share the view that while offsets can bring short-term jobs, they can also distort the market and raise prices[\\[12\\]](@brauer_arms_2004%20#:~:text=Accordingly%2C%20the%20starting%20point%20for,will%20be%20trade%20diversion%2C%20trade)[\\[40\\]](https://parbery.com.au/making-it-stick-overcoming-the-impediments-to-delivering-on-defences-australian-industry-capability-aspirations/#:~:text=,such%20arrangements%20in%20favour). This is why bodies like the WTO and EU discourage them. Even the United States, the world's top arms exporter, has an official policy that views offsets as \"market distorting\" - but U.S. companies nonetheless engage in offsets because *not doing so would mean losing contracts* to European or other competitors who will offer them[\\[45\\]](@dehoff_defense_2014#:~:text=Western%20defense%20companies%20looking%20to,compensation%20arrangements%20with%20foreign%20governments)[\\[121\\]](@dehoff_defense_2014#:~:text=nondomestic%20suppliers,sales%20relationships%20in%20foreign%20markets). The U.S. requires contractors to report all offset agreements to the Department of Commerce, which publishes an annual report on offsets in defense trade (indicating tens of billions in obligations are active at any time)[\\[122\\]](@dehoff_defense_2014#:~:text=Although%20they%20are%20not%20usually,Guy). That data shows U.S. firms from 1993-2012 entered about \\\\\\$70B in offset agreements, mainly to Europe and the Middle East[\\[122\\]](@dehoff_defense_2014#:~:text=Although%20they%20are%20not%20usually,Guy).\n\nThus, even in Western supplier nations, offsets have indirectly shaped the industry by pushing companies to globalize their supply chains - sometimes outsourcing work to the buying country's factories (which in some cases are subsidiaries or joint ventures of the same company). The line between offsets and normal business blurs here, echoing Hall and Markowski's point that an offset is ultimately a part of a larger complex transaction[\\[123\\]](@brauer_arms_2004%20#:~:text=%E2%80%9COffsets%20are%20simply%20goods%20and,179)[\\[124\\]](@brauer_arms_2004%20#:~:text=The%20jab%E2%80%94that%20offsets%20are%20%E2%80%9Cthose,%E2%80%9Cprimary%20contract%E2%80%9D%20and%20that%20which). The difference is perspective: economists may frown upon it, but as long as buyer governments **\"universally acknowledge\"** their benefits in securing domestic political support[\\[125\\]](https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/implementation-indias-defence-offset-policy#:~:text=streamlined%20regulatory%20environment), offsets or their equivalents will remain a fixture of defence procurement.\n\nHaving reviewed these cases, we can draw comparisons across countries.
