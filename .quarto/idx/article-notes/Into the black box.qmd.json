Using three linked cases—the multinational F-35 programme, Saab’s Gripen export strategy (including co-development offers), and India’s MMRCA fighter competition plus evolving offset policy—the paper shows how “friendship” is neither necessary nor sufficient for winning major deals; instead, perceived capability fit, supplier reliability, and willingness/ability to share technology dominate. The F-35 case highlights the tension between interoperability benefits of sharing sensitive technology with allies and the US interest in maintaining technology leadership—especially around stealth and software source code (“the black box”).
