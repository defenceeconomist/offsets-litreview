towards non-EU markets and European firms rely more on exports.\n- The paper distinguishes **direct offsets** (linked to the procured system) from **indirect offsets** (unrelated), plus “defence-related” vs “non-defence-related” indirect offsets.\n- **Credit value** can exceed **actual value** through **multipliers**, allowing recipient states to steer supplier behaviour towards preferred activities (notably technology transfer).\n- Consulting forecasts cited suggest rising cumulative global offset obligations, with strong growth in APAC and/or MENA depending on the source.\n- Recipient countries are described as moving from indirect towards direct offsets, emphasising **Transfer of Technology (ToT)** and long-term partnerships.\n- Growing obligations create **financial** and **reputational** risks for suppliers if commitments become hard to fulfil.\n- EU policy discouraging offsets contrasts with non-EU strategic use of offsets as industrial policy to build local DTIB capability.\n- Effective absorption of offset investments is presented as challenging; offsets need to link to broader R&D/R&T and capability-building plans to have durable effects.\n\n## Realist synthesis coding\n\n### CMO 1: Budget shifts drive exporter dependence on offset-heavy markets\n- **Context:** Shrinking European defence budgets and constrained domestic demand; strong competition for non-EU procurement.\n- **Mechanism:** European firms prioritise exports and accept ambitious offset requirements to win access and contracts.\n- **Outcome:** Increased exposure to large offset obligations, with heightened financial/reputational risk and potential pressure on competitiveness.  \n\n### CMO 2: Recipient industrial policy shifts offsets towards ToT and co-production\n- **Context:** Non-EU states (e.g., Brazil, India, Turkey, South Korea) seek to build DTIB capacity and enter global supply chains.\n- **Mechanism:** Offset policies increasingly require direct offsets (co-development/co-production/licensed production) and ToT as deal conditions.\n- **Outcome:** More demanding offset packages centred on capability transfer and longer-term industrial partnerships.  \n\n### CMO 3: Multipliers steer supplier behaviour but complicate value assessment\n- **Context:** Recipient governments need leverage to prioritise “high value” activities within an offset programme.\n- **Mechanism:** Multipliers raise credited offset value for targeted activities (e.g., technology transfer), separating credited fulfilment from actual spend.\n- **Outcome:** Supplier incentives align with recipient priorities, while analysts and policymakers must distinguish credit vs actual value when judging impact.  \n\n### CMO 4: Weak European-level

Firms optimise for short-term deal success and profitability, without fully accounting for long-term impacts on EDTIB technological edge.\n- **Outcome:** Potential erosion of European technological competitiveness, even if individual firms achieve near-term export gains.\n\n## Meta-index tags\n\n**Document type**\n- Conference paper / report\n\n**Core concepts**\n- Defence offsets\n- Industrial
