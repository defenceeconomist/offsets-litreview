  - country: "**India**"
    offset_policy_timeline_and_reforms: |
      **2005**: Formal offset policy introduced in DPP 2005 (30% offset on deals ≥ ₹300 Cr)\
      **2006-2013**: DPP revisions expanded scope to civil aerospace & internal security, added offset banking\
      **2016**: Further tweaks in DPP; **2020**: DAP 2020 effectively **diluted offsets** - removed requirement for G-to-G and single-vendor deals (offset no longer mandatory in those cases).
    offset_types: |
      **Mandatory** (until 2020 reforms) for large contracts; **Direct offsets only**
      (defence, aerospace, security sectors) - no pure civil offsets.
    primary_aims: |
      **Industrial**: Build indigenous defence industry, self-reliance (reduce imports)\
      **Strategic**: Technology transfer for advanced systems, increase autonomy in critical military tech.
    key_mechanisms_and_features: |
      **Co-production & License manufacture** (e.g. local assembly of aircraft)\
      **Local subcontracting** (foreign OEM must source components from Indian firms)\
      **FDI in joint ventures** and **R&D collaboration** (with credit multipliers for high-tech, SME involvement)\
      **Rigid MoD oversight** (Offset Partner approval, penalties for shortfall - though enforcement has been weak).

    offset_types: |
      **Mandatory** (for most major arms imports, ~35% offset);
      Allows **Direct & Indirect** - defense or civilian projects that create jobs/tech (flexible interpretation).
    primary_aims: |
      **Industrial/Economic**: Diversify economy, create high-tech and manufacturing jobs for Saudis.\
      **Strategic**: Localize support & maintenance, gain some autonomy and leverage in supplier relationships.
    key_mechanisms_and_features: |
      **Joint Venture investments**: foreign contractors must invest in Saudi-foreign JV companies
        (aerospace, electronics, chemicals).\
      **Local content requirements**: preference/priority for Saudi products and subcontractors.\
      **Indirect projects** allowed (e.g. civilian education or technology parks).\
      Implementation via Economic Offset Committee; enforcement gaps
        (~$4.5B achieved vs ~$45B expected by 2006).

      (e.g. food security, ICT) and set 7-year project timelines.
    offset_types: |
      **Mandatory** for defence contracts over threshold (~AED 36M);
      **Mixed** direct & indirect; expanded to strategic civil sectors.
    primary_aims: |

      **Strategic**: Build domestic defense sector, autonomy, and high-value exports.
    key_mechanisms_and_features: |
      **Joint ventures and new company creation** (≥40 JVs facilitated by Tawazun).\
      **Foreign investment in UAE projects** (defence and strategic civil sectors).\
      **Credit multipliers** for priority fields (AI, cyber).\
