      context: Turkey emphasizes offsets, co-production, and export licenses in procurement.
      mechanism: These requirements conflict with U.S. export laws.
      outcome: U.S. firms face greater difficulty obtaining Turkish contracts.

      supporting_evidence: "provide offsets, allow co-production, and\nissue export licenses at the bidding stage can be at odds with U.S. arms export laws"
      supporting_evidence_paraphrase: The text states that Turkey’s offset and co-production emphasis can conflict with U.S. export laws, making contracts harder for U.S. firms.
      confidence: medium
      confidence_justification: The conflict is explicitly stated; the outcome is inferred.
    zanotti_11_pdf__cmo_003:
      context: Turkey seeks industrial self-reliance through procurement.
      mechanism: Turkey turns to more flexible suppliers willing to share expertise.
      outcome: Turkey shifts toward non-U.S. suppliers that are less advanced but more flexible.

      supporting_evidence: "Turkey looks\nto other suppliers that may not be as technologically advanced or reliable"
      supporting_evidence_paraphrase: The text indicates Turkey looks to other suppliers that are less advanced but more flexible, supporting self-reliance goals.

      context: Turkey’s strategic procurement policy targets offset returns.
      mechanism: Offset requirements are set as a percentage of contract value.
      outcome: Procurement agreements require at least 50% offset return for contracts ≥ $10 million.
