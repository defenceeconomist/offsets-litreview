        - rq3
        - rq5
      supporting_evidence: "the offset requirement has slowed the already laborious procurement process"
      supporting_evidence_paraphrase: "The chapter cites press reporting that offset requirements were dropped from later Saudi–US deals because they slowed an already laborious procurement process, implying a transaction-cost mechanism."
      confidence: "medium"
      confidence_justification: "The claim is supported by a reported quote, but the evidence is indirect (press reports) and does not quantify the delay."
    09_saudi_arabia_and_offsets_pdf__cmo_039:
      context: "International trade regimes may classify offsets as non-tariff barriers, creating a risk of formal prohibition for member states."
      mechanism: "If the strict interpretation prevails that offsets violate trade rules, states face external constraints and may need to weigh trade-access gains against loss of offset policy tools."
      outcome: "Offset programmes can be threatened or constrained by trade-regime membership and international legal interpretations."
      programme: "unknown_programme"
      country: "multi_country"
      evidence_type: "case_study"
      evidence_type_narrative: "Policy/legal discussion in the Saudi chapter generalising to the wider issue of offsets under GATT rules and potential implications for multiple countries."
      research_questions_mapped:
        - rq3
        - rq5
      supporting_evidence: "the view that offset is a non-tariff barrier to trade would preclude all GATT members from running offset programmes"
      supporting_evidence_paraphrase: "The chapter argues that under a strict GATT interpretation, offsets could be treated as prohibited non-tariff barriers, implying a structural constraint on the use of offsets by GATT members."
      confidence: "medium"
      confidence_justification: "The policy implication is stated clearly but remains contingent on contested legal interpretation rather than demonstrated enforcement outcomes."

      status: warn
      note: "Captured major claims about Saudi offset programme design (objectives, governance, crediting, financing), technology-transfer constraints (skills, R&D, firm reluctance), and case evidence (Peace Shield/Al Yamamah ventures, trade/procurement frictions)."
    - check: evidence_traceability
      status: warn
      note: "Most CMOs use short direct quotes; a few mechanisms/outcomes reflect author recommendations or interpretive synthesis (marked low/medium confidence accordingly)."
    - check: context_is_condition
      status: pass
      note: "Contexts are framed as conditions (skills scarcity, trade-regime constraints, obligation structure, governance arrangements, financing/infrastructure dependencies) rather than activities."
    - check: mechanism_is_causal
      status: warn
      note: "Mechanisms are expressed as incentive and capability pathways; several are policy-design arguments (e.g., R&D-centre emphasis) rather than observed behavioural responses."
    - check: outcome_is_effect
      status: warn
      note: "Most outcomes are effects (cost premiums, participation patterns, domestic MRO/electronics capability, delays, policy constraints). A small number are programme-design shifts framed as recommendations and are marked low confidence."
