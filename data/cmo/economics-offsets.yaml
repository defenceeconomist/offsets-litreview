      context: "Defence budgets are constrained and unemployment pressures rise, making indigenous development costly and politically difficult."
      mechanism: "To reconcile cheaper imports with domestic economic expectations, purchasers impose offset obligations that compel foreign vendors (and subcontractors) to place additional purchases/investment in the buyer’s economy."
      outcome: "Imports proceed while some domestic employment/industrial activity is generated via vendor-directed purchases beyond the core contract."

      supporting_evidence: "As defence budgets have been cut and unemployment has risen, purchasers have sought a less costly form of procurement."

    01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_002:
      context: "The purchasing country’s industrial base is relatively small and underdeveloped, limiting the feasible volume of domestic sourcing."
      mechanism: "Because vendors cannot readily meet offset obligations through local purchasing, offset packages pivot toward inward investment and joint-venture style commitments to satisfy obligations and inject capability."

      confidence: high
      confidence_justification: "The passage directly links a specific context (underdeveloped industrial base) to a specific shift in offset implementation (inward investment)."
    01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_003:
      context: "Offsets are commercially sensitive and politically contentious, and key actors in government and industry hold vested interests."
      mechanism: "Limited disclosure and strategic presentation of claims by interested parties reduces data availability and impedes independent assessment."

    01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_004:
      context: "Indirect offsets are treated as a discretionary policy instrument, with alternative domestic-content arrangements available."
      mechanism: "Once policymakers recognise indirect offsets impose real costs and weak performance, they demote indirect offsets to a fallback while shifting emphasis to direct local-content requirements."

    01_introduction_and_overview_pdf__cmo_006:
      context: "Regional political imperatives intersect with an already over-capacity defence industry."
      mechanism: "Offset obligations steer work to politically prioritised regions and firms, sustaining inefficient producers and discouraging rationalisation by masking underlying industrial weaknesses."
      outcome: "Short-term maintenance of the industrial base occurs, but budget purchasing power falls and future procurement choices become constrained by dependence on offset work."

      context: "The domestic industrial base is too small to absorb offset work through local purchasing, and prior defence-focused offset facilities lacked sufficient demand."
      mechanism: "Offset policy is oriented toward international joint ventures (with equity/capital and facilitation by offset-obligated firms) in non-defence sectors where market demand and growth prospects are stronger."
