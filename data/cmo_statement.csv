Early agreements were based on unrealistic expectations and “best endeavours” commitments.  There is now a shift towards more focused offsets such as joint ventures and banking credits.,"Initial misperceptions led vendors to underestimate costs and buyers to assume offsets guaranteed orders.  Penalties and banked credits were introduced to enforce compliance and encourage continuous work.  Joint ventures tie foreign and domestic firms together, promoting long‑term cooperation and accountability.","Focused measures and penalties improved performance, but lack of data still hinders robust evaluation.  Competitive pressures mean offsets continue, though the form is evolving towards deeper partnerships.","The concluding chapter synthesises lessons from multiple cases: successful offsets require clear data, realistic expectations and credible enforcement.  Moving away from broad, transactional offsets to targeted joint ventures and equity investments may yield better industrial and alliance outcomes.",qmd_note,auto
