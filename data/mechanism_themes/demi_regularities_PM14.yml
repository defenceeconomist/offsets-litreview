        statement: "In contexts where buyers have bargaining power in oligopolistic high-technology markets and pursue industrial-policy goals beyond price, rent extraction via offset requirements tends to yield procurement-linked domestic industrial participation (jobs, orders, technology/market access) rather than only lower base prices."
        context_conditions:
          - "Purchasers have bargaining power in large procurements and suppliers face concentrated/oligopolistic market structures."
          - "Governments pursue multiple objectives (employment, technology acquisition, market access) beyond allocative efficiency."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Industrial participation requirements are built into contracts to secure domestic activity and spillover benefits."
          - "Offset objectives broaden to include technology transfer and investment/buyback rather than pure price discounting."

        statement: "In contexts where buyers can condition award decisions on offset terms and control offset-crediting details, rent extraction via offset requirements tends to yield expanded (or above-headline) commitments as suppliers concede additional economic activities to secure market access."

          - "Offset packages include additional compensatory activities beyond the core sale."

        statement: "In contexts where purchasing jurisdictions seek reciprocity from trading partners that require offsets, rent extraction via offset requirements tends to yield diffusion of offset-credit practices to sub-national procurement as authorities insist on offset credit and allocate it to local firms."

      - "The dominant pattern emphasizes offsets as a bargaining/rent-extraction instrument used to pursue multiple non-price objectives (employment, technology transfer, investment, market access)."
      - "Evidence is stronger on buyer leverage and objective expansion than on systematic measurement of net welfare effects or distributional consequences."
