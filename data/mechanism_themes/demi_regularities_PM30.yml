        statement: "In contexts where macro/trade-policy distortions (e.g., overvalued exchange rates or rationed foreign exchange) are addressed through offsets/countertrade rather than direct reforms, using offsets as second-best substitutes for broader macro/trade reform tends to yield continued transactions without overt policy change but embeds inefficient, transaction-specific adjustment and policy mis-targeting."
