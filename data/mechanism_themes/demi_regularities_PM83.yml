        statement: "In contexts where importing countries face scarce hard-currency reserves or constraints on hard-currency payments, mandating countertrade to conserve foreign exchange tends to yield continued imports alongside reciprocal purchasing and export-generation requirements intended to protect foreign-exchange reserves."
        context_conditions:
          - "Hard-currency reserves are small and hard-currency payments are constrained."
          - "Governments mandate countertrade as a policy instrument."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Imports proceed while reciprocal transactions are used to manage hard-currency constraints and potentially generate additional exports."

        confidence_justification: "A high-confidence synthesis CMO explicitly links scarce foreign exchange to mandated countertrade as a conservation strategy and describes the intended import/reciprocal-transaction outcome."
      - demi_regularity_id: "PM83_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where offsets allow deferred counter-sales and local manufacturing obligations after contract signature, countertrade as foreign-exchange conservation tends to yield shifted timing and composition of payments (later counter-payments and domestic employment) that reduce net foreign-currency burden over time and ease balance-of-payments pressures."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offset execution can occur after contract signature via deferred counter-sales or local manufacturing obligations."
          - "Buyers prioritize reducing foreign-currency outflows over time."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Payment burdens are shifted over time and partially compensated through later counter-payments and domestic employment."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 2 PM83 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports a core foreign-exchange conservation rationale (imports proceed with reciprocal requirements) and a design feature of shifting payment timing via deferred counter-sales and local manufacturing."
      - "This theme describes intended macro constraints management; it does not by itself establish net welfare gains relative to alternative macro adjustments."
