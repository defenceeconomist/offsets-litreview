        statement: "In contexts where a weapons purchase proceeds regardless of offsets and policymakers aim to reduce collateral economic harm, specifying development-oriented indirect offsets (capital inflows, appropriate technology transfer, transferable skills, new markets) and emphasizing transparency tends to yield more realized and development-relevant offset activity (albeit often modest and contingent on enforceability)."
        context_conditions:
          - "The procurement is expected to proceed regardless of whether offsets are attached."
          - "Offset requirements are specified to target development-oriented outcomes and transparency is emphasized."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset activity is more likely to be development-relevant and realized rather than purely nominal."
          - "Offsets may modestly soften the procurement’s economic burden, subject to enforceability."

        statement: "In contexts where immediate employment creation is a political priority (e.g., high unemployment and labor-market absorption needs), development-oriented indirect offset design tends to yield offset baskets emphasizing people-intensive, near-term work (such as software development and contract R&D) rather than only long-term industrial initiatives."
        context_conditions:
          - "High unemployment creates pressure for rapid job creation."
          - "Offset authorities design baskets to prioritize near-term, labor-absorbing activities."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset baskets focus on people-intensive and near-term work and target immediate employment needs."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 3 PM12 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports two design logics: (a) transparency and development-oriented specifications to improve realization, and (b) tailoring baskets toward near-term employment when job creation is urgent."
      - "The transparency/design recommendation is largely prescriptive in one source; the employment-priority design is case-traced with high-confidence evidence."
