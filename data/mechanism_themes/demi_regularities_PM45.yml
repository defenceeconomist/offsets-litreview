        statement: "In contexts where urgency of supply or treaty/security quid-pro-quo dominates procurement decisions, security urgency overriding offset aims tends to yield de-emphasis of offsets and selection of off-the-shelf purchases to secure faster and simpler delivery."
        context_conditions:
          - "States prioritize supply urgency or alliance/treaty considerations."
          - "Industrialization goals via offsets are secondary under urgent security conditions."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset demands are minimized or rejected in favor of off-the-shelf procurement."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM45_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where buyers have limited bargaining leverage and acquisition urgency is high, and suppliers resist co-production on political or economic grounds, security urgency overriding offset aims tends to yield acceptance of reduced production participation to secure delivery of needed systems."
        context_conditions:
          - "Diplomatic isolation or other constraints reduce bargaining leverage."
          - "Acquisition urgency is high and suppliers resist co-production."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Buyers forego significant production shares or participation to secure delivery."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 2 PM45 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports a consistent priority ordering: when urgent security needs dominate, offsets and co-production aims are traded away for timely procurement."
      - "Bargaining leverage appears as a key contextual moderator: isolation and supplier resistance increase the likelihood of reduced participation outcomes."
