      - "Evidence strongly supports the 'rigidity → diseconomies' logic and provides multiple concrete flexibility mechanisms (variable bargaining, capped/tie-break offsets, voluntary/niche participation, and substitution away from expensive modes)."
      - "When synthesizing, keep distinct the sub-cases: (a) bilateral procurement bargaining flexibility, (b) policy guardrails that prevent offsets distorting supplier choice, and (c) multinational program constraints where offsets are institutionally excluded."
