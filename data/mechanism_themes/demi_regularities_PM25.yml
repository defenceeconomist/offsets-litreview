        statement: "In contexts where barter and in-kind offset trades are statistically less visible than monetary transactions, reduced price visibility tends to yield difficult-to-detect price discrimination and dumping in world markets."
        context_conditions:
          - "Transactions are structured as barter or in-kind offset trade rather than transparent monetary sales."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Price discrimination and dumping become easier to execute and harder to detect."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM25_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where exporters face price restrictions, agreements, or political constraints that make explicit price-cutting difficult, using barter and counterpurchase to obscure effective prices tends to yield disposal of surplus output or market entry at lower effective prices without visible nominal price changes."
        context_conditions:
          - "Price-cutting is constrained by agreements or political restrictions."
          - "Barter/counterpurchase structures can obscure the effective transaction price."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Firms can dispose of stock or enter markets at effectively lower prices while avoiding visible nominal price changes."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 2 PM25 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports an opacity pathway: barter/counterpurchase reduces price transparency and enables de facto price discrimination and dumping."
      - "Further evidence would be needed to quantify the magnitude and distributional consequences of these pricing effects across markets."
