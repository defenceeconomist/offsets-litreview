        statement: "In contexts where a country maintains open, competitive domestic defence procurement but faces protectionism abroad, systematic second-best import offset rules tends to yield regular requests for industrial participation on significant offshore content as a necessity to secure technology transfer and investment in prioritized capabilities."
        context_conditions:
          - "Domestic procurement is open and competitive."
          - "Foreign markets apply protectionist policies that limit reciprocal access."
          - "Import offsets/IP rules are applied systematically to offshore content."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Import offsets are requested regularly to secure technology transfer and investment in prioritized capability areas."

        statement: "In contexts where offset requirements are asymmetric across partner countries and firms perceive competitive disadvantage in export markets, systematic second-best import offset rules tends to yield calls for reciprocal 'level playing field' policies that require offsets from countries demanding offsets from domestic exporters."
        context_conditions:
          - "Domestic firms face offset demands in export markets while domestic import policy is perceived as less demanding."
          - "Asymmetry creates perceived competitive disadvantage."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Firms and stakeholders call for reciprocal offset requirements toward countries that demand offsets from domestic industry."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 2 PM49 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports second-best framing of import offsets as responses to protectionism and as instruments for reciprocity/level playing field concerns."
      - "More evidence would be needed to assess whether systematic IP rules reduce or exacerbate broader offset ratcheting dynamics across markets."
