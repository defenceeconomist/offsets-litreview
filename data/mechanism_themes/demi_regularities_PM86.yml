    theme_label: "Buyer coalitions increase bargaining leverage"
    mechanism_explanation: "When multiple buyers pool purchases and coordinate negotiation, they increase bargaining leverage, improving terms (including offsets) and supporting longer, more efficient production runs."

        statement: "In contexts where small buyers coordinate procurement with partners and pool purchases, presenting as a coordinated buyers’ cartel tends to yield increased bargaining leverage that improves offset terms and supports longer production runs compared with isolated national purchases."
        context_conditions:
          - "Small buyers face limited bargaining power in major procurements when acting alone."
          - "Purchases are pooled and negotiations are coordinated across partners."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Improved offsets arrangements and better terms relative to isolated purchases."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM86_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where buyer coalitions use procurement structure to pressure for component and parts sub-contracts as offsets, buyer coalition bargaining leverage tends to yield constrained offset delivery when local suppliers cannot meet required quality standards and workforce capability, delaying or reducing component-offset implementation."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offsets are pursued through subcontracted components and parts orders."
          - "Local supplier capability is constrained by quality standards and workforce skills."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Component-offset delivery is delayed or reduced when local suppliers struggle to meet required quality standards."

        counterexamples: []
        confidence: "high"
        confidence_justification: "A high-confidence CMO provides an explicit quality-capability constraint on component subcontracting outcomes, indicating a clear boundary condition on coalition leverage translating into realised offsets."
    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 2 PM86 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports a leverage pathway (coalitions improve terms) and a capability boundary condition (quality/workforce constraints can delay or reduce realised component offsets)."
      - "More evidence would be needed to assess how coalition governance and internal distribution rules affect who benefits from improved terms."
