        statement: "In contexts where buyers pursue industrial participation but must preserve value-for-money procurement, specifying strict eligibility criteria (defence-related/high-technology, \"new\" work, technical equivalence, time-bounded ordering, and no additional cost) tends to yield screened offset crediting that limits re-labelling and prevents offsets from overriding equipment/price decisions."
        context_conditions:
          - "Purchasers seek offsets/industrial participation while maintaining value-for-money procurement norms."
          - "Offset eligibility is defined by criteria emphasizing defence relevance, high-technology content, additionality, and contract scope/duration."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Only work meeting criteria is eligible for offset credit."
          - "Industrial participation is treated as secondary to equipment/price; offset offers may lose (not win) contracts."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM50_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where policymakers accept that offsets raise weapon costs relative to off-the-shelf purchases, applying explicit or implicit cost-premium ceilings for direct offsets tends to yield continued political acceptance of offsets while constraining acceptable value-for-money deviations."
        context_conditions:
          - "Stakeholders recognise offsets are not costless and may raise weapon costs."
          - "Rules-of-thumb or thresholds guide acceptable cost differentials for direct offsets."

          - "Offsets remain accepted with an implicit or explicit cost-premium ceiling."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM50_DR_03"
        statement: "In contexts where broad offset programmes are recognised as costly and potentially subsidy-like, tightening eligibility and focusing offsets on priority areas tends to yield a shift away from general programmes toward more targeted measures."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offsets are seen as imposing resource costs and risking broad subsidy effects if eligibility is wide."
          - "Policymakers seek to allocate scarce resources more strategically."

      - "Coverage: all 4 PM50 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports a value-for-money protection strategy via strict eligibility and additionality criteria; offsets are framed as constrained secondary considerations."
      - "Additional evidence would help assess whether cost-premium ceilings and programme narrowing reliably prevent welfare losses or simply re-label them."
