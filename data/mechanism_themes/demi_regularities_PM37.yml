        statement: "In contexts where budget constraints motivate export reform to spread development costs across more buyers, expanding the buyer pool through exports and offsets tends to yield a shift from restraint toward facilitation, with more permissive stances on offsets and reduced emphasis on guarding technological edge."
        context_conditions:
          - "Military services seek to expand export buyers under budget pressure."
          - "Exports/offsets are seen as tools to broaden the buyer pool and make sales work for customers."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Services adopt more permissive stances on offsets."
          - "Technological-edge guardianship is weakened relative to customer facilitation objectives."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM37_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where offset impacts are uncertain and administrations are reluctant to endanger high-technology export sales, expanding the buyer pool through exports tends to yield ambivalent hands-off governance (\"benign neglect\") and delayed implementation of reporting or regulatory steps that could constrain offsets."
        context_conditions:
          - "Policymakers face uncertainty about whether offsets harm national interests."
          - "Administrations are reluctant to take actions that could threaten export competitiveness."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset policy remains ambivalent and hands-off."
          - "Reporting/regulation implementation can be delayed, reflecting low priority and avoidance of restricting exporters."

        statement: "In contexts where governments seek to uphold free-trade norms while accommodating firms’ commercial flexibility, expanding the buyer pool through exports tends to yield permissive countertrade guidance that restricts government promotion but does not oppose company participation except where national security concerns arise."
        context_conditions:
          - "Countertrade and offsets spread beyond defence into civilian exports."
          - "Policy aims include balancing free-trade principles with exporter flexibility."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Government agencies are prohibited from promoting countertrade, but may provide advisory/market services."
          - "Company participation is generally not opposed unless national security would be harmed."

      - "Evidence indicates permissiveness can emerge from budget/export-competition incentives and from uncertainty about offset harms, producing ambivalent or delayed regulation."
      - "A clear boundary condition is national security: permissive commercial flexibility is conditional on not crossing security-risk thresholds."
