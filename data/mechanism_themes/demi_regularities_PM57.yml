        statement: "In contexts where offset delivery is pursued through government-to-government frameworks (e.g., FMS and MOUs), export support building offset capacity tends to yield reduced barriers to partner-country participation through policy waivers and administrative support (buy-national waivers, export-license support, data access), enabling offset-eligible work via procurement channels."

          - "Procurement occurs under government-to-government channels with formal agreements assigning offset responsibilities."
          - "Policy barriers (buy-national rules, licensing, data access) affect partner-country participation."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Waivers and support provisions increase feasibility of partner-country bids for offset-eligible work."

      - "Evidence supports both organisational support (helping firms build offset projects) and policy support (waivers and licensing/data assistance) as export-support mechanisms."
      - "Further evidence would help distinguish effects on small vs large firms and whether export-support capacity primarily improves compliance or also improves additionality/value-for-money."
