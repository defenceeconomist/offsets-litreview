        statement: "In contexts where arms purchases strain domestic capital and hard-currency resources (especially in capital-short economies), external finance expands resource pool tends to yield partial mitigation of the purchase burden by bringing in fresh, externally financed offset/grant resources rather than reallocating scarce domestic finance."

          - "Purchasing countries face chronic capital scarcity and/or hard-currency constraints."
          - "Offset-related investment or development projects are financed through external sources (e.g., grants or capital raised outside the purchasing country)."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Net inflows of external capital can partially counterbalance the resource drain of the arms purchase."
          - "Development-oriented projects funded as grants soften the economic burden to a limited extent."

      - "PM5 evidence spans grant/capital inflows, concessional credit and local-currency/countertrade terms, and development-fund/soft-loan/equity financing that relaxes capital constraints."
      - "A key boundary condition is macro-financial context: higher money costs can erode the attractiveness of delayed-payment/offset-linked local production schemes."
      - "Several CMOs focus on finance terms that function as offset-equivalent inducements; future coding could distinguish financing mechanisms from production/technology-transfer offsets where needed."
