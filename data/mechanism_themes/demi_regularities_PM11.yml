        statement: "In contexts where standardisation and off-the-shelf procurement would reduce costs but conflicts with domestic political markets and producer/bureaucratic interests, domestic arms-industry influence tends to yield compensatory procurement forms (co-production, work-sharing, licensed production, offsets) as second-best solutions that preserve domestic participation."

          - "Procurement deviates from full standardisation toward arrangements that preserve domestic industrial roles."

      - "Evidence is strongest on domestic-industry pressure producing direct-offset subsidies and on political incentives sustaining mandatory offsets despite efficiency critiques."
      - "A recurring within-theme variation concerns whether offsets are framed as second-best substitutes for standardisation/cost-reduction versus as explicit industrial-crisis responses."
