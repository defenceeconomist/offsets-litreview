  theme_label: Legitimation through economic framing
  mechanism_explanation: Presenting offsets as economic benefits or conditional support shifts decision-makers’ and publics’
    cost-benefit reasoning, making purchases more politically acceptable.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_001
    text: By offering cost offsets framed as economic benefits, sellers provide an inducement that shifts decision-makers’
      reasoning from reluctance to acceptance.
    rationale: Frames offsets as economic benefits that shift decision-makers toward acceptance.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_002
    text: By embedding compensatory work in an offset package, officials can present support to domestic producers as a condition
      of purchase rather than a visible subsidy, reducing political costs.
    rationale: Uses offset packaging to present support as a purchase condition, lowering political exposure.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_003
    text: By making offsets appear to deliver large economic benefits (even if illusory), officials reduce perceived net costs
      and increase public acceptance.

  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_021
    text: Promised offset benefits provide an argument that reframes the purchase as economically beneficial, reducing resistance.
    rationale: Reframes the purchase as economically beneficial to reduce resistance.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_003
    text: Because expected benefits are more salient than expected costs, officials adopt offsets even when net welfare effects
      are ambiguous.
    rationale: Benefit salience drives adoption despite ambiguous net welfare.
  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_010
    text: Buyer ability to extract economic activity and know-how via offsets increases willingness to import superior foreign
      systems, reinforcing exporter dominance while forcing work-sharing back to buyer countries.

  theme_label: Compliance shaped by incentives and monitoring
  mechanism_explanation: 'Delivery depends on the enforcement regime: transparency and credible incentives/penalties encourage
    compliance, while weak oversight and accounting games reduce real fulfilment.'
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_004
    text: Shifts in conditions, contractor fortunes, or bad faith reduce the ability and incentives to complete promised offset
      activities, especially when enforcement is weak.

      without creating genuinely additional business.
    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.
  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_006
    text: Suppliers may accept obligations but later default, and although buyers can attempt incentive contracts, enforcement
      is difficult in practice.
    rationale: Enforcement difficulties allow suppliers to default despite contractual attempts to incentivize compliance.
  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_013
    text: Suppliers can promise offsets to win contracts and later renege or deliver less value, because timing and enforcement
      frictions weaken purchaser leverage.
    rationale: Timing and enforcement frictions enable reneging or under-delivery after contract award.
  - id: 04_economic_aspects_of_arms_trade_offsets_pdf__cmo_019
    text: If the exporter would have pursued the same partnerships through normal due diligence regardless of offset credit,
      then the offset does not cause the business relationship; it only changes accounting labels.
    rationale: Credits can relabel business relationships that would occur anyway, inflating apparent delivery.
  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_008
    text: Long fulfillment horizons and crediting practices allow firms to receive offset credit exceeding transactional fulfillment
      value.
    rationale: Crediting practices can overstate fulfillment relative to real value delivered.
  - id: 05_arms_trade_as_illiberal_trade_pdf__cmo_016
    text: Licensed production/technology sharing associated with offsets increases opportunities for diversion, while enforcement
      is inadequate and undetected transfers likely exceed detected cases.
    rationale: Weak enforcement allows diversion of licensed production and technology sharing.
  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_005
    text: The threat of reduced consideration for future bids provides an informal enforcement incentive to meet offset targets.

    text: Multipliers and penalty-backed obligations increase incentives for investment and technology transfer into pre-determined
      local sectors.
    rationale: Multipliers and penalties strengthen incentives for investment and transfer.
  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_013
    text: When pre-existing or follow-on work is counted as offset credit, the true incremental value of offsets is overstated
      and accountability weakens.
    rationale: Counting pre-existing work as credit inflates delivery and weakens accountability.
  - id: 06_defense_offsets_policy_versus_pragmatism_pdf__cmo_014
    text: Credit banking relaxes immediate delivery constraints and enables long-term, multi-project clearing, but can reduce
      transparency about what is delivered for a given contract.
    rationale: Credit banking reduces transparency about delivery tied to a contract.
  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_005

      current procurement and compensatory activity.
    rationale: Restricting banking preserves coupling between procurement and compensatory activity.
  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_007
    text: Denmark avoids financial penalties because it acknowledges penalties raise import prices, instead using supplier
      blacklisting; Norway uses withheld-payment sanctions; Finland/Sweden accept economic sanctions.
    rationale: Sanctions/blacklisting create enforcement incentives without necessarily raising prices via penalties.
  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_011
    text: Complex and heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentage values from actual work delivered, complicating
      audits and comparisons.

  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_003
    text: Because additionality is difficult to measure and work may be re-labeled or low quality, credited projects do not
      reliably represent new economic activity.
    rationale: Relabeling or low-quality work undermines additionality and accountability.
  - id: 11_offsets_in_belgium_between_scylla_and_charybdis_pdf__cmo_012
    text: Through pre-compensations (offset banking credits), suppliers count normal trade flows as offsets against future
      obligations.
    rationale: Pre-compensation credits allow normal trade to count against future obligations.
  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_005
    text: By applying multipliers (including exceptionally high ones), policymakers can inflate credited offset value beyond
      underlying transaction costs, enabling “headline” offset totals.
    rationale: High multipliers inflate credited offset value beyond underlying transactions.
  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_006
    text: Non-terminable agreements and liquidated damages (up to 100% of outstanding obligations) raise expected costs of
      non-compliance and are intended to enforce delivery.

    rationale: Parallel bargaining and project specification reduce ambiguity and lock suppliers into deliverables.
  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_010
    text: Because credited value is set to reflect value to the economy rather than actual provision costs, administrative
      crediting can decouple “credit” from real effort.
    rationale: Administrative crediting can decouple value credited from real effort.
  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_012
    text: Multipliers and differing valuation conventions enable large gaps between “nominal,” “net,” and “gross” reported
      offset values, complicating verification.
    rationale: Multipliers and valuation conventions create large gaps between nominal and net values.
  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_013
    text: By insisting on specific offset projects and obligations rather than an open agreement, Poland attempts to lock
      in hard commitments and reduce supplier discretion.
    rationale: Specific projects and obligations reduce supplier discretion and lock in commitments.
  - id: 12_the_defense_industry_in_poland_an_offsets_based_revival_pdf__cmo_015
    text: Low liquidated-damages rates reduce the expected cost of non-performance, making it rational for a supplier to pay
      penalties instead of fully discharging obligations in some cases.
    rationale: Low liquidated damages lower expected non-performance costs, enabling strategic non-compliance.
  - id: 13_offsets_and_the_development_of_the_brazilian_arms_industry_pdf__cmo_018
    text: Multipliers raise credited value for higher-priority activities (technology transfer, training, licensing/copro)
      and thereby steer supplier effort toward capability-building deliverables.

    rationale: Passes offset costs into the sale price to recover premiums.
  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_004
    text: Because there is no unique benchmark price, suppliers can embed offset-related costs into the offered weapons price
      without the buyer being able to verify price padding.
    rationale: Lack of benchmark prices enables embedding offset costs into the sale price.
  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_005
    text: Suppliers accept offset obligations only when the overall package yields satisfactory returns, adjusting the weapons
      price upward if needed or walking away otherwise.

  theme_label: Subcontracting buy-in reduces influence
  mechanism_explanation: When subcontracts are awarded commercially, partner nations must pay to participate and accept less
    than full industrial influence and participation.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_010
    text: When subcontracts are awarded commercially, partner nations must pay for participation and accept less than full
      influence and less than full industrial participation.
    rationale: Commercial subcontracting forces partners to pay for reduced influence.

  theme_label: Complexity hinders auditability
  mechanism_explanation: Heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentages from actual delivery, complicating
    audits and comparisons.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_011
    text: Complex and heterogeneous offset arrangements decouple headline percentage values from actual work delivered, complicating
      audits and comparisons.
    rationale: Heterogeneous arrangements obscure real delivery and auditability.
- theme_id: PM73
  theme_label: Policy relaxation after poor returns
  mechanism_explanation: When costs are high and gains disappoint, policies adjust to allow lower or zero offset requirements.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 09_nordic_offset_policies_changes_and_challenges_pdf__cmo_012
    text: Recognizing higher costs and lower-than-expected gains prompts policy revisions to allow less than 100% offsets
      or even zero in specific cases.
    rationale: High costs and low gains motivate lower or zero offset requirements.
- theme_id: PM74
  theme_label: Disclosure constraints obscure evaluation
  mechanism_explanation: Limited data access and vested interests constrain disclosure, making it difficult to separate fact
    from fiction in offset evaluation.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_002
    text: Limited data access and vested interests in industry and government constrain disclosure and complicate separating
      fact from fiction.
    rationale: Data access limits and vested interests obscure evaluation.
- theme_id: PM75
  theme_label: Counterfactual uncertainty undermines additionality
  mechanism_explanation: When counterfactual outcomes are unknown, analysts must assume them, creating fundamental uncertainty
    about additionality.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_003
    text: Because it is unknown what would have happened without the offset obligation, analysts must assume a counterfactual,
      introducing fundamental uncertainty about additionality.
    rationale: Unknown counterfactuals create fundamental uncertainty about additionality.
- theme_id: PM76
  theme_label: Compliance risk increases prices
  mechanism_explanation: Suppliers insure against penalties and compliance risks by raising contract values; administrative
    burdens also increase costs, obscuring true offset price premiums.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_004
    text: Suppliers insure against penalty and compliance risks by raising contract values, and administrative burdens also
      increase costs, obscuring the true price premium of offsets.
    rationale: Suppliers raise prices to insure against penalties and compliance risks.
- theme_id: PM77
  theme_label: Heterogeneity limits generalization
  mechanism_explanation: Differences in offset types and goals produce divergent effects and require different evaluation
    approaches, limiting generalization.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_005
    text: Heterogeneity in offset types and goals produces different economic effects and requires different evaluation methods,
      limiting generalization.
    rationale: Diverse offset types require different evaluation methods and limit generalization.
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_012
    text: Indirect offsets (reciprocal purchases unrelated to the arms deal) obscure causal attribution and complicate evaluation
      compared to direct offsets.
    rationale: Indirect offsets complicate causal attribution relative to direct offsets.
- theme_id: PM78
  theme_label: Exports concentrate in incumbents
  mechanism_explanation: Offset-generated exports concentrate in existing trade relations and traditional products from large
    exporters, limiting SME exports and job creation.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_007
    text: Offset-generated exports concentrate in existing trade relations and traditional products from large exporters,
      limiting SME exports and job creation.
    rationale: Exports concentrate in incumbents, limiting SME gains.
- theme_id: PM79
  theme_label: Evaluation uncertainty weakens value claims
  mechanism_explanation: When additionality and cost impacts are uncertain, demanding full offsets can yield questionable
    net value and misdirect defence budgets toward export promotion.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_009
    text: When additionality cannot be established and costs are unknown, demanding 100% offsets can yield questionable net
      value and misdirect defense budget resources toward general export promotion.
    rationale: Uncertain additionality and costs make full offset demands low-value.
- theme_id: PM80
  theme_label: Firm gains but weak national benefit
  mechanism_explanation: Offset receipt can correlate with firm income/employment gains even when national net benefits are
    limited and misaligned with policy goals.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_010
    text: Statistical association between receiving offsets and firm income/employment growth can coexist with limited national
      net benefit and poor alignment with policy goals.
    rationale: Firm-level gains can coexist with weak national net benefit.
- theme_id: PM81
  theme_label: Offsets extend activity beyond program life
  mechanism_explanation: Emphasis on indirect offsets is used to extend industrial activity beyond the life of a specific
    procurement program, sustaining work over time.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 10_evaluating_defense_offsets_the_experience_in_finland_and_sweden_pdf__cmo_015
    text: Emphasis on indirect offsets was initially used to extend industrial activity beyond the life of a specific procurement
      program.
    rationale: Indirect offsets are used to extend industrial activity beyond a single program.
