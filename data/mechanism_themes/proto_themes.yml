  theme_label: Legitimation through economic framing
  mechanism_explanation: Presenting offsets as economic benefits or conditional support shifts decision-makers’ and publics’
    cost-benefit reasoning, making purchases more politically acceptable.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_001
    text: By offering cost offsets framed as economic benefits, sellers provide an inducement that shifts decision-makers’
      reasoning from reluctance to acceptance.
    rationale: Frames offsets as economic benefits that shift decision-makers toward acceptance.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_002
    text: By embedding compensatory work in an offset package, officials can present support to domestic producers as a condition
      of purchase rather than a visible subsidy, reducing political costs.
    rationale: Uses offset packaging to present support as a purchase condition, lowering political exposure.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_003
    text: By making offsets appear to deliver large economic benefits (even if illusory), officials reduce perceived net costs
      and increase public acceptance.
    rationale: Emphasises perceived benefits to reduce net-cost perceptions and build public acceptance.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_021
    text: Promised offset benefits provide an argument that reframes the purchase as economically beneficial, reducing resistance.
    rationale: Reframes the purchase as economically beneficial to reduce resistance.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_003
    text: Because expected benefits are more salient than expected costs, officials adopt offsets even when net welfare effects
      are ambiguous.
    rationale: Benefit salience drives adoption despite ambiguous net welfare.
- theme_id: PM2
  theme_label: Compliance shaped by incentives and monitoring
  mechanism_explanation: 'Delivery depends on the enforcement regime: transparency and credible incentives/penalties encourage
    compliance, while weak oversight and accounting games reduce real fulfilment.'
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_004
    text: Shifts in conditions, contractor fortunes, or bad faith reduce the ability and incentives to complete promised offset
      activities, especially when enforcement is weak.
    rationale: Weak enforcement and changing conditions reduce incentives and capacity to fulfil obligations.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_005
    text: Structuring offset agreements to maximize transparency and create credible incentives/penalties increases supplier
      compliance with offset obligations.
    rationale: Transparency plus credible incentives/penalties raise compliance with obligations.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_006
    text: By counting pre-existing transactions as meeting offset obligations, suppliers inflate apparent offset delivery
      without creating genuinely additional business.
    rationale: Counts pre-existing transactions to appear compliant without additional delivery.
- theme_id: PM3
  theme_label: Cost pass-through via pricing
  mechanism_explanation: Suppliers internalise offset costs and recover them by raising the weapon sale price, shifting the
    burden to buyers.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_007
    text: Vendors incorporate offset premiums into the weapons selling price to recoup offset costs.
    rationale: Passes offset costs into the sale price to recover premiums.
- theme_id: PM4
  theme_label: Offsets crowd out civilian resources
  mechanism_explanation: Offset activity can absorb scarce capital, labour, or productive capacity, diverting resources away
    from civilian sectors that would otherwise drive development.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_008
    text: Military-sector offset work diverts productive resources away from civilian production that contributes more directly
      to development.
    rationale: Military offset work redirects productive resources away from civilian development uses.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_013
    text: When offset activity is financed domestically, it crowds out local investment opportunities by absorbing limited
      capital from within the purchasing country.
    rationale: Domestic financing absorbs scarce capital, displacing other investments.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_015
    text: If offset projects simply hire already skilled workers from the limited local pool, they preempt labor needed by
      domestic civilian producers.
    rationale: Hiring scarce skilled workers for offsets deprives civilian producers of needed labour.
- theme_id: PM5
  theme_label: External finance expands resource pool
  mechanism_explanation: When funding comes from external sources, offsets inject new resources rather than reallocating domestic
    capital, easing the net drain of purchases.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_011
    text: External grant funding adds resources for development projects, partially counterbalancing the resource drain of
      the arms purchase.
    rationale: External grants inject new resources that offset the arms purchase drain.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_012
    text: When offset investment is financed from outside the purchasing country, it increases net capital availability rather
      than reshuffling scarce domestic finance.
    rationale: Foreign-financed investment adds net capital rather than reallocating domestic funds.
- theme_id: PM6
  theme_label: Additional trade yields net gains
  mechanism_explanation: Counterpurchase that generates genuinely additional exports creates new revenue streams and supports
    employment.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_010
    text: When counterpurchase creates genuinely additional export sales (not otherwise achievable or less profitable without
      the deal), it increases revenue and supports productive civilian employment.
    rationale: Genuinely additional counterpurchase exports create new revenue and jobs.
  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_003
    text: By requiring reciprocal purchases to be additional (“new activity”), the offset policy aims to create exports that
      would not otherwise occur.
    rationale: Additionality requirements aim to create exports that would not otherwise occur.
- theme_id: PM7
  theme_label: Training expands local skill supply
  mechanism_explanation: Mandated employer-funded training expands the local skill base, increasing labour supply instead
    of depleting it.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_016
    text: Requiring employer-financed training that raises lower-skilled workers to the needed level expands the local skill
      pool rather than draining it.
    rationale: Employer-funded training increases the skill pool rather than drawing it down.
- theme_id: PM8
  theme_label: Transferability and contextual fit
  mechanism_explanation: 'Spillovers hinge on transferability and fit: military-origin skills/technologies often mismatch
    civilian contexts, and careful selection and implementation reduce adaptation failures and costs.'
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_014
    text: Skills developed for performance-driven, cost-insensitive military production are not easily transferable (or require
      costly reshaping) to civilian production needs.
    rationale: Military-production skills do not transfer easily to civilian needs without costly reshaping.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_017
    text: Because military technologies often require costly reshaping for civilian uses, pursuing civilian technology directly
      is generally more cost-effective.
    rationale: Military technologies need costly adaptation, making civilian tech more efficient.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_018
    text: When transferred technologies are incompatible with the receiving environment, they fail to function effectively
      or to integrate into productive systems.
    rationale: Incompatible transferred technologies fail to function or integrate productively.
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_019
    text: Selecting appropriate technologies and implementing transfer carefully increases the likelihood that transferred
      technologies are usable and development-relevant.
    rationale: Careful selection and implementation improve usability of transferred technologies.
- theme_id: PM9
  theme_label: Barter eases constraints, reduces transparency
  mechanism_explanation: Barter arrangements relax financial constraints but reduce transparency, creating mutual advantage
    for supplier and buyer.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_009
    text: Barter bypasses financial constraints and reduces transaction transparency, which can advantage both supplier and
      purchasing government.
    rationale: Barter circumvents finance constraints while lowering transparency for both parties.
- theme_id: PM10
  theme_label: Offsets as supplier differentiator
  mechanism_explanation: When core capability requirements are fixed, offset offers differentiate suppliers and influence
    selection.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_020
    text: Offsets function as a differentiator between suppliers when core capability requirements are fixed.
    rationale: Offsets become a competitive lever when core requirements are fixed.
- theme_id: PM11
  theme_label: Domestic industry influence on offsets
  mechanism_explanation: Domestic arms-industry influence shapes procurement demands, pushing governments to require direct
    offsets that effectively subsidize local military industry.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_022
    text: Domestic arms-industry influence pushes governments to demand direct offsets that subsidize local military industry
      as part of foreign procurement.
    rationale: Domestic arms-industry influence drives demands for direct offsets that subsidize local industry.
- theme_id: PM12
  theme_label: Development-oriented indirect offset design
  mechanism_explanation: Specifying development-oriented indirect offsets and emphasizing transparency increases the likelihood
    that promised activities are realized and development-relevant.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 01_do_offsets_mitigate_or_magnify_the_military_burden_pdf__cmo_023
    text: Requiring development-oriented indirect offsets (capital inflows, appropriate technology transfer, transferable
      skills, and/or new markets) and emphasizing transparency increases the chance of realization and development relevance.
    rationale: Targets indirect offsets and transparency to improve realization and development relevance.
- theme_id: PM13
  theme_label: Offsets shift competition to bundled content
  mechanism_explanation: Requiring offset packages redirects competition away from price/quality and toward bundled content,
    even when that content is unrelated to the procured item.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_001
    text: By requiring benefits packages alongside the base good, offsets redirect competition away from price/quality toward
      bundled content that may be unrelated to the procured item.
    rationale: Benefits packages shift competition from price/quality to bundled content.
- theme_id: PM14
  theme_label: Rent extraction via offset requirements
  mechanism_explanation: Offset policy compels suppliers to transfer economic activity domestically, extracting rents from
    the price margin and enabling governments to pursue multiple objectives through procurement.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_002
    text: Offset policy extracts rent off the price margin by requiring sellers to transfer economic activity into the domestic
      economy, allowing governments to pursue multiple objectives through procurement.
    rationale: Uses offset requirements to extract rents and channel activity into the domestic economy.
- theme_id: PM15
  theme_label: Flexibility reduces mandate diseconomies
  mechanism_explanation: Rigid, one-size mandates constrain negotiation and force offsets where market exchange would be superior,
    creating diseconomies of scale and scope; variable policies increase flexibility and reduce these losses.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_004
    text: A one-size-fits-all mandate constrains negotiation dimensions and creates diseconomies of scale and scope by forcing
      offsets where market exchange would be superior.
    rationale: One-size mandates force offsets where market exchange is superior, creating diseconomies.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_010
    text: A variable offset policy increases negotiation flexibility and the opportunity set, allowing comparison of price-margin
      exchange versus offsets and reducing diseconomies of scope.
    rationale: Variable policies expand negotiation options and reduce diseconomies of scope.
- theme_id: PM16
  theme_label: Offsets justified in high-hazard exchanges
  mechanism_explanation: Offsets can substitute for poorly functioning markets in high-hazard exchanges and yield reputational
    or capability gains; imposing offsets in low-hazard contexts or misaligned with seller capabilities creates opportunity
    costs and raises costs.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_005
    text: Offsets are advisable only when exchange hazard is high and expected recipient benefits are high, because offsets
      can substitute for poorly functioning markets and unlock reputational/capability gains.
    rationale: Offsets substitute for poorly functioning markets when hazards and expected benefits are high.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_012
    text: Imposing offsets in low-hazard categories forces content-based contracting where price-margin savings would be superior,
      creating opportunity costs.
    rationale: Imposing offsets in low-hazard categories creates opportunity costs versus price-margin savings.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_014
    text: Direct offsets better safeguard hazardous exchanges by tying performance to the procured system, while indirect
      offsets are more applicable for wider development objectives but can raise costs if outside seller capabilities.
    rationale: Direct vs indirect offsets should match exchange hazards and seller capabilities to avoid cost inflation.
- theme_id: PM17
  theme_label: Administrative burden and rent-seeking
  mechanism_explanation: Offset regimes can generate administrative burdens and rent-seeking, including proposal overload,
    superficial evaluation criteria, and discretionary behaviour that raises costs without improving transfer outcomes.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_006
    text: In this setting, offsets add administrative burden and rent-seeking costs without improving technology transfer
      or exchange integrity.
    rationale: Offsets add administrative burden and rent-seeking without improving transfer or exchange integrity.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_011
    text: Variable offset policies increase discretion between price and content, attracting internal and external rent-seeking;
      strict mandatory triggers constrain discretion and can reduce rent-seeking.
    rationale: Discretion in variable policies attracts rent-seeking, while strict triggers constrain it.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_013
    text: Broad mandates generate proposal overload and encourage superficial evaluation criteria (e.g., workload and jobs)
      rather than technology-transfer quality, while atomistic sellers add offset burdens that raise prices with little reputational
      effect.
    rationale: Broad mandates overload evaluation and encourage superficial criteria, raising costs with little reputational
      effect.
- theme_id: PM18
  theme_label: Objective ambiguity undermines evaluation
  mechanism_explanation: Mixed objectives and unclear incidence of benefits make it difficult to specify evaluation criteria
    and determine net beneficiaries of mandated offsets.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_002
    text: Mixed objectives and unclear incidence of benefits make it difficult to specify evaluation criteria and to identify
      who gains net benefits from mandated offsets.
    rationale: Mixed objectives obscure evaluation criteria and who gains net benefits.
- theme_id: PM19
  theme_label: Supplier coaching and reputational certification
  mechanism_explanation: Suppliers teach efficient routines to control costs and quality, and successful completion provides
    reputational certification that lowers domestic firms’ market-entry transaction costs.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_007
    text: To minimize its own costs and ensure quality, the seller has incentives to teach efficient routines; successful
      completion also provides a reputational “stamp of approval” that lowers the domestic firm’s market-entry transaction
      costs.
    rationale: Supplier coaching and reputational stamps reduce transaction costs for domestic firms.
- theme_id: PM20
  theme_label: Alliance incentives via offset waivers
  mechanism_explanation: Governments use bargaining power or offset waivers to encourage alliances, boosting investment and
    reputational capital while preserving competitive selection.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_008
    text: Government uses bargaining power to encourage alliances without mandating offsets (e.g., best-endeavors), preserving
      market competition while enabling collaboration.
    rationale: Uses bargaining power to encourage alliances without mandatory offsets.
  - id: 02_using_procurement_offsets_as_an_economic_development_strategy_pdf__cmo_009
    text: By waiving offset requirements for foreign firms that enter strategic alliances, the program increases long-term
      investment and channels reputational capital to domestic firms while maintaining competitive selection.
    rationale: Offset waivers for alliances incentivize investment and reputational capital while maintaining competition.
- theme_id: PM21
  theme_label: Market access conditioned on reciprocity
  mechanism_explanation: Requiring reciprocal activity as a condition of market access imposes trade-restricting requirements
    on exporters.
  mechanisms:
  - id: 03_mandatory_defense_offsets_conceptual_foundations_pdf__cmo_001
    text: By mandating reciprocal activity (countertrade, local content, or bundled enhancements) as a condition of market
      access, the importing state imposes trade-restricting requirements on exporters.
    rationale: Conditions market access on reciprocal activity, restricting trade.
