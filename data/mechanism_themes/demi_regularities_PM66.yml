        statement: "In contexts where weapon-system sophistication and scale make domestic production unviable and imports rise, offsets as import compensation tends to yield continued foreign procurement alongside compensatory technology transfer, licensed production/parts work, and export opportunities intended to build domestic industrial capability."

          - "Domestic production in small numbers is not viable or local capability limits make imports unavoidable."

          - "Foreign procurements are paired with offset quid pro quo (technology transfer, licensed production, buy-backs, parts/component exports)."
          - "Offsets become channels for market-access and technology acquisition objectives linked to major imports."
