        statement: "In contexts where countries share similar structural features but differ in defence industrial policy, export policy, and state–industry relationships, institutional path dependence in offset policy tends to yield divergent offset strategies and implementation practices shaped more by historical trajectories and institutional arrangements than by immediate transaction features."

        statement: "In contexts where earlier IRB/offset packages create and embed firms in defence supply chains, institutional path dependence in offset policy tends to yield constrained future procurement options as later contracts rely on the previously created firm as a default prime, increasing dependence on defence contracts."

        statement: "In contexts where a state is primarily an exporter, rarely demands offsets on imports, and prefers collaborative development programmes over off-the-shelf imports, institutional path dependence in offset policy tends to yield lack of a stable formal offsets framework and case-by-case handling of import offsets."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 3 PM48 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports path dependence at two levels: (a) cross-national institutional trajectories shaping strategy, and (b) firm-creation effects constraining future procurement options."
      - "Within-theme variation includes contexts with weak institutionalisation (case-by-case import offsets) versus contexts where IRB-driven embedding creates strong procurement dependence."
