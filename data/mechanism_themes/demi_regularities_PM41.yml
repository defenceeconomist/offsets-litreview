        statement: "In contexts where arms-trade policy is shaped by interagency economic bargaining and multilateral control forums are weakened, economic priorities overriding security restraint tends to yield reduced integration of security evaluations into trade decisions, potentially increasing long-run proliferation risks."

        statement: "In contexts where procurement decisions are used to pursue broader political-economic strategies (e.g., trade diversification goals), economic priorities overriding security restraint tends to yield platform selection and contracting choices influenced by political motives even when military requirements and alliance politics create friction."
        context_conditions:
          - "Procurement is linked to broader political strategies beyond defence (e.g., trade diversification)."
          - "Military requirements and alliance politics can conflict with political-economic objectives."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Platform selection incorporates significant political motives alongside (and sometimes against) military considerations."

      - "Evidence supports a 'low-threat/low-salience' pathway where political-economic objectives dominate procurement and IRB design, reinforced by multi-department governance."
      - "System-level accounts suggest economic imperatives can weaken integration of security evaluations, but additional case-traced evidence would strengthen claims about proliferation-risk consequences."
