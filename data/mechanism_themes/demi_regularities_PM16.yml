        statement: "In contexts where mandatory offsets are imposed in low-exchange-hazard and low-technology procurement categories, offsets as substitutes for markets tends to yield opportunity costs and reduced welfare because content-based contracting displaces more efficient price-margin savings."
        context_conditions:
          - "Exchange hazard is low and items are low-technology (many routine procurement categories)."
          - "Mandatory offsets impose content-based contracting rather than relying on market price competition."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Welfare is reduced because foregone price discounts exceed offset benefits in these settings."

        statement: "In contexts where offsets are used primarily to safeguard hazardous exchanges, choosing direct offsets rather than indirect offsets tends to yield better exchange integrity outcomes, while using offsets for broader development objectives tends to yield greater relevance for indirect offsets but with higher cost risk when obligations are outside seller capabilities."
        context_conditions:
          - "Governments use offsets either to safeguard hazardous exchanges or to pursue broader development strategy goals."
          - "Offset design choices include direct (tied to the procured system) versus indirect (wider economic activity) forms."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Direct offsets are more aligned with safeguarding hazardous exchanges."
          - "Indirect offsets are more applicable for wider development objectives but can raise costs if misaligned with seller capabilities."

      - "Evidence supports a strong hazard-based boundary: offsets are argued to be appropriate primarily under high exchange hazard and high expected recipient benefits."
      - "Within-theme variation is mainly about offset form choice (direct vs indirect) and the welfare consequences of extending mandates into low-hazard procurement categories."
