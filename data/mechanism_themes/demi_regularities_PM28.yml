        statement: "In contexts where buyer-country firms face high search and transaction costs to penetrate foreign markets, large exporters’ established marketing and distribution networks tends to yield improved market access by enabling marketing-assistance and counterpurchase offsets that place buyer-country products more efficiently than domestic firms could."
        context_conditions:
          - "Search, marketing, and transaction costs for foreign market entry are high for buyer-country firms."
          - "Exporting firms have established networks, product knowledge, and distribution capability."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Counterpurchase goods and buyer-country products are placed with lower marketing/search costs."
          - "Purchasers secure third-party buyers or improved export market access as part of offset packages."

        confidence_justification: "High-confidence CMOs directly describe exporters’ superior marketing capability lowering costs of placing countertrade goods and provide a concrete marketing-assistance example; a supporting CMO adds the general network-cost logic."

        statement: "In contexts where offset crediting grants one-for-one (full value) credits for facilitating host-country exports, exporter networks tends to yield stronger contractor incentives to broker matches between host-country products and the contractor’s wider supplier network, increasing supply-chain insertion opportunities."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offset crediting includes credit for facilitating exports from the host economy, not only for joint-venture output."
          - "Credits are awarded on a one-for-one basis, making export facilitation highly credit-efficient."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Contractors search for and broker matches between host-country products and their supply-chain input needs."
          - "Host-economy manufacturers gain access to global supply chains associated with the prime contractor."

        statement: "In contexts where offset transactions are predominantly indirect and used to improve foreign firms’ cost/quality competitiveness, exporter networks and offset channels tends to yield asymmetric competitive advantages for foreign firms, with little reverse technology transfer back to the exporter’s home economy."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offsets are largely indirect and involve activities that reduce costs or improve quality and competitiveness."
          - "Reverse technology transfer is not a dominant feature of offset transactions."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Competitive advantages shift toward foreign firms in world and US markets."
          - "Reverse technology transfer to the exporter’s home economy is rare."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 5 PM28 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "The dominant pattern is marketing-network advantage: exporters can reduce market-entry costs for counterpurchase goods and buyer-country exports."
      - "Design details (e.g., one-for-one export credits) strengthen incentives for supply-chain brokering; however, some indirect-offset patterns may shift competitiveness toward foreign firms rather than facilitating reciprocal gains."
