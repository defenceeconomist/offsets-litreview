        statement: "In contexts where buyers join major programmes early as development partners and work is allocated competitively on 'best value' rather than guaranteed shares, early partnership enabling high-tech roles tends to yield opportunities for meaningful industrial participation and development roles, conditional on technology access agreements and export-control approvals."
        context_conditions:
          - "Buyers join early as programme partners (including investment contributions)."
          - "Work allocation is competitive rather than formally apportioned."
          - "Technology access depends on agreements and export-control approval."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Industrial participation (jobs, exports, potential technology access) is linked to partnership status and competitiveness rather than a one-off offset package."

        statement: "In contexts where political and fiscal constraints lead buyers to procure existing proven platforms to minimise technical risk, early partnership enabling high-tech roles tends to yield limited access to development-phase participation and weaker technology-transfer outcomes than would be expected from earlier buy-in."

        statement: "In contexts where no suitable off-the-shelf platform meets unique operational requirements and procurement involves developmental-stage buy-in, early partnership enabling high-tech roles tends to yield higher offset/IRB guarantees and greater technology-transfer potential through deeper participation in production and systems-integration work."

      - "Evidence emphasizes conditionality: early partnership and competitive allocation can enable high-tech roles, but outcomes depend on export controls and on whether procurement occurs early enough to embed firms in development."
      - "Within-theme variation contrasts proven-platform purchases (lower risk, weaker tech transfer) with developmental-stage buy-in (higher guarantees, deeper participation)."
