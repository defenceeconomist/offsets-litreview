        statement: "In contexts where offset-induced local sourcing is only marginally competitive and tied to a one-off procurement, offset-induced sourcing tends to yield temporary industrial participation that dries up once obligations are fulfilled unless there is follow-on work or sustained competitiveness."

          - "Local sourcing is driven primarily by contract-specific offset obligations."
          - "Local suppliers are only just competitive or have limited prospects of follow-on work."

          - "Subcontracting and industrial participation end when the supplier meets its offset requirements."
          - "Long-run industrial strengthening and durable collaboration are limited."

        statement: "In contexts where offset-placement forces exploration of new suppliers, offset-induced sourcing tends to yield durable sourcing relationships when the discovered sources are genuinely lower-cost or otherwise competitive, but short-term placement when they are not."

        statement: "In contexts where investment-based compensation depends on continued domestic orders and alignment of buyer–seller interests, offset-induced sourcing tends to yield visible foreign-investor dissatisfaction and exit threats when follow-on demand is weak, limiting long-term collaboration benefits."

          - "Buyer–seller interests diverge (investors seek orders and returns; domestic partners seek promised technology/marketing transfers)."

      - "Coverage: all 5 PM23 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "A consistent pattern is that offset-sourcing benefits are often time-bounded to obligation periods unless competitiveness or follow-on demand supports continuation."
      - "Evidence suggests durability is more likely when offsets reveal genuinely competitive suppliers; otherwise effects are transient and can generate conflict in investment-based arrangements."
