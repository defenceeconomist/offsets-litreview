        statement: "In contexts where indirect offsets impose obligations in sectors unrelated to the weapon system and include cost/quality improvement support for foreign firms, hidden injuries from offset competition tends to yield competitive disadvantages and resource misallocation for non-defence firms that may not recognize offsets as the source of intensified competition."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offsets are indirect and affect firms outside the defence supply chain."
          - "Offset activity supports foreign firms’ competitiveness (cost/quality improvements) in broader markets."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Non-defence firms face competitive disadvantage and 'hidden' harms linked to offset-driven competition."
          - "Competition intensification may be poorly understood by affected sectors."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM39_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where politicians and governments are vote-sensitive and contractors emphasize offset benefits while downplaying costs, hidden injuries from offset competition tends to yield decision-making that privileges visible jobs/technology narratives and obscures diffuse competitive harms borne by other sectors."
        context_conditions:
          - "Procurement decisions are politically salient and actors emphasize offset benefits."
          - "Costs and efficiency losses are downplayed relative to visible narratives."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offsets are politically attractive and can distort industrial-participation decision-making, masking who bears costs and competitive harms."

        confidence_justification: "A high-confidence CMO explicitly links political incentives to emphasis on offset benefits over costs, consistent with a mechanism that obscures diffuse harms."
    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 3 PM39 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports both an economic-competition pathway (offsets strengthening competitors and harming non-defence sectors) and a political pathway (benefit narratives obscuring diffuse harms)."
      - "Empirical quantification of competitive harm is limited in the extracted CMOs; claims are mainly qualitative/analytical."
