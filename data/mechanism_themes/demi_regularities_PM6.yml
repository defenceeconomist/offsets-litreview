        statement: "In contexts where counterpurchase obligations generate genuinely additional export sales (rather than displacing existing exports or offering lower profitability), additional trade via counterpurchase tends to yield increased revenue inflows (especially hard currency) and productive employment that partially mitigates the economic burden of military procurement."
        context_conditions:
          - "Counterpurchase is used to compensate for procurement costs via export expansion and revenue inflows."
          - "Offset-linked exports are additional (\"new activity\") relative to baseline exports."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Increased export revenues, including hard-currency inflows."
          - "Support for productive civilian employment and partial mitigation of procurement’s negative economic impacts."

        statement: "In contexts where counterpurchase obligations are implemented through large commodity/raw-material purchasing commitments tied to contract value, additional trade via counterpurchase tends to yield increased commodity exports and reduced net payment for the importer via reciprocal demand created by the arms sale package."
        context_conditions:
          - "Contracts include counterpurchase obligations to buy commodities/raw materials from the purchasing economy."
          - "Counterpurchase shares are substantial relative to contract value."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Commodity exports to the seller (or nominated buyers) increase as part of the arms deal."
          - "The purchasing state treats reciprocal demand as partially offsetting contract value."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 3 PM6 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "The key boundary implied by the evidence is additionality: net gains depend on whether counterpurchase creates genuinely new export revenue and employment rather than reallocation."
      - "Evidence includes both a conceptual additionality requirement and a concrete commodity-counterpurchase implementation example."
