    mechanism_explanation: "High offset demands in one market raise reciprocal expectations elsewhere; shifting toward more indirect offsets can reduce financial risk and preserve established supply chains."

        statement: "In contexts where high offset demands are pursued (e.g., 100%) and firms compete across multiple markets, offset reciprocity and supply-chain risk tends to yield ratcheting expectations ('going rates') and reciprocal pressure on exporters, increasing caution about escalating demands."
        context_conditions:
          - "Purchasers seek high offset percentages and compare requirements to international benchmarks."
          - "Exporters anticipate being asked for reciprocity in other markets."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset percentage expectations climb over time."
          - "Exporters and policymakers become wary that demanding high offsets increases what domestic firms will be asked for abroad."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM51_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where established production and supplier networks limit scope for direct work on the purchased system, offset reciprocity and supply-chain risk tends to yield predominance of indirect offsets as firms preserve existing supply chains and meet obligations through off-platform work."
        context_conditions:
          - "The purchased system is already in production with established supplier sources."
          - "There is limited scope to reallocate direct work within the platform supply chain."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Most offset value is delivered as indirect offsets rather than direct work tied to the purchased equipment."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM51_DR_03"
        statement: "In contexts where policymakers seek offsets but want to reduce financial risk and avoid destabilising supply chains under reciprocity pressures, shifting toward indirect offsets tends to yield a perceived stability/efficiency rationale for indirect forms over direct work reallocation."
        context_conditions:
          - "There is concern that high direct-offset demands can be counterproductive via reciprocity dynamics."
          - "Maintaining established supply chains and limiting financial risk are valued."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Indirect offsets are preferred or justified as more stable and less risky than direct reallocation."

        confidence: "medium"
        confidence_justification: "The rationale for preferring indirect offsets to reduce reciprocity-linked risk is supported by a high-confidence comparative statement, but outcome tracing across multiple programmes is limited within this theme."
    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 4 PM51 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports two linked patterns: escalating expectations via international benchmarking and reciprocity pressure, and limited scope for direct offsets in mature production supply chains resulting in predominantly indirect delivery."
      - "Further evidence would help distinguish when indirect offsets genuinely reduce risk versus merely shifting offset burdens to less transparent or less additional transactions."
