        statement: "In contexts where defence procurement is treated as an exceptional (security-driven) domain and offsets are mandated by governments rather than privately negotiated, market access conditioned on reciprocity tends to yield trade-restricting procurement arrangements that shape exporter behavior beyond the base arms purchase."

          - "Offsets are mandatory requirements imposed by the importing state as a condition of market access."
          - "Arms trade operates under security exceptionalism outside standard liberalized trade regimes."

          - "Exporters face trade-restricting obligations (countertrade, local content, bundled enhancements) tied to contract award."
          - "Procurement functions as a protectionist arrangement shaping trade flows beyond the weapon-system purchase."

        statement: "In contexts where defence budgets are constrained, unemployment pressures are salient, and indigenous development is politically or fiscally difficult, market access conditioned on reciprocity tends to yield continued imports alongside compensatory domestic work, technology acquisition, and industrial recovery efforts."

        statement: "In contexts where buyers make advanced technology transfer (e.g., software source code) a core reciprocity condition, market access conditioned on reciprocity tends to yield bidder disadvantage or exclusion for suppliers constrained by export-control and technology-release limits."

      - "Coverage: all 10 PM21 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports two linked patterns: (a) offsets as mandatory trade restrictions in an illiberal security-exempt market, and (b) offsets as a way to reconcile imports with domestic jobs/technology expectations."
      - "Constraints and boundary pressures arise from export-control limits on technology transfer and from trade-regime interpretations that treat offsets as non-tariff barriers."
