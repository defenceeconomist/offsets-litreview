        statement: "In contexts where collaborative procurement relies on non-competitive work splitting (juste retour) and multi-layer governance (committees or unanimity rules), multi-layer governance and non-competitive work splitting tends to yield inefficiency, higher costs, and delays through slower decisions and blurred accountability."
        context_conditions:
          - "Work is allocated by national shares rather than competition/comparative advantage."
          - "Decision-making is mediated by multi-layer committees and/or unanimity requirements."

          - "Programme governance is cumbersome, contributing to delays and inefficiency."
          - "Accountability is blurred and decisions slow relative to more competitive allocation and simpler governance."

        statement: "In contexts where offsets are subject to regional distribution rules and political bargaining (e.g., under federalisation), multi-layer governance around work allocation tends to yield fragmentation, excess capacity, and inefficient production flows that are difficult to rationalise."
