        statement: "In contexts where offset transactions are commercially and politically sensitive and routinely published data are scarce, constrained disclosure (limited data access plus vested interests) tends to yield evaluations that are difficult, partial, and vulnerable to selective narratives because analysts cannot easily separate fact from advocacy."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offsets are commercially sensitive and politically vulnerable (e.g., jobs claims) and details are not routinely published."
          - "Industry and government actors have vested interests in shaping how offsets are portrayed."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Independent economic evaluation is rare and difficult."
          - "Assessment relies on partial information and goodwill, increasing the risk of biased or selective claims."

        statement: "In contexts where basic information on offset programme costs, benefits, and contract details is not available (due to secrecy and weak data systems), constrained disclosure tends to yield thin evidence bases and limited ability to assess additionality, cost-benefit, or macroeconomic impact."

          - "Contract details are confidential and precise programme information is missing."
          - "Statistical services and data-collection capacity are insufficient for assembling evaluation datasets."

          - "Quantitative estimates of effectiveness are limited and the empirical literature remains thin."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM74_DR_03"
        statement: "In contexts where offsets/IRBs are politically charged and diplomatically sensitive, constrained disclosure tends to yield reduced transparency because officials and industry avoid open discussion and terminology, further impeding research and scrutiny."
        context_conditions:

        statement: "In contexts where national industries both give and receive offset work, constrained disclosure tends to yield partial verification opportunities when analysts compare incoming vs outgoing offset claims to cross-check likely employment and technology effects."

    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 8 PM74 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "The central recurring barrier is lack of routinely published, precise programme data due to confidentiality and sensitivity, which limits independent scrutiny and cost-benefit assessment."
      - "One mitigation pathway appears where an industry both gives and receives offsets, enabling limited cross-checking of claims, but this does not substitute for transparent programme data."
