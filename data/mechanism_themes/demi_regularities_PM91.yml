    mechanism_explanation: "When quality standards constrain what can be credibly purchased under counterpurchase obligations, compliance shifts toward service-based offsets or experiences delays and friction in industrial purchasing."

        statement: "In contexts where purchaser-side industrial products do not meet exporter-side quality requirements for counterpurchase, quality standards constraining industrial counterpurchase tends to yield friction, contestation, and delays in meeting industrial-offset obligations."
        context_conditions:
          - "Industrial products available for counterpurchase do not meet required quality standards."
          - "Offsets are expected to be met through industrial goods purchasing."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset fulfillment slows and becomes contested due to quality constraints."

      - demi_regularity_id: "PM91_DR_02"
        statement: "In contexts where industrial counterpurchase is difficult under strict quality constraints and service purchases are permissible, quality constraints shifting offset form tends to yield substitution toward service-based offsets (e.g., tourism) that are easier to fulfil than manufacturing-goods purchases."
        context_conditions:
          - "Service-based offsets are allowed as fulfilment pathways."
          - "Industrial-goods purchasing faces high friction due to quality constraints."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset packages shift toward services to improve fulfilment feasibility."

        confidence_justification: "A high-confidence CMO explicitly compares industrial purchases to tourism offsets and states services are easier to fulfil under quality constraints."
    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 2 PM91 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports a clear substitution mechanism: quality constraints impede industrial counterpurchase and encourage shifts toward service-based offsets."
      - "This theme highlights an implementation boundary: what counts as fulfilment can change in response to feasibility constraints."
