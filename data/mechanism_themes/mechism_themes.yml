themes:
  - theme_id: "THEME_01"
    theme_label: "Building capability via technology transfer and licensed production"
    theme_description: "Offsets condition procurement on transfers (technology, training, licensed production/coproduction) that provide resources for learning-by-doing and incremental capability accumulation in domestic firms. Include actor-response processes such as learning, adaptation, and competence-building; exclude descriptions that only state that transfer occurred without a generative process."
    theme_justification: "Topic 0 repeatedly emphasizes technology transfer, licensed production, training, and learning-by-doing, and its representative summaries describe shortened learning timelines and competence-building. Topic -1 also links procurement choices and transfers to maintaining domestic production/technology capability."

  - theme_id: "THEME_02"
    theme_label: "Channeling demand toward domestic firms through procurement preference"
    theme_description: "Procurement rules and priorities create protected or preferential demand that enables domestic firms to invest, learn, and sustain capability over time. Include processes where ordering rules, domestic-first strategies, or conditional access reshape firm incentives and learning; exclude themes focused mainly on export performance or price pass-through."
    theme_justification: "Topic -1 (Domestic procurement strategies) highlights domestic-first ordering, local production preferences, and maintaining production/technology capability through demand and learning. Its representative summaries describe ranking domestic procurement and using policy conditions to channel learning into domestic firms."

  - theme_id: "THEME_03"
    theme_label: "Inducing supplier compliance through quantified obligations and credible incentives"
    theme_description: "Offset schemes translate policy goals into measurable obligations, crediting rules, timelines, and penalties/incentives that reshape supplier behavior toward meeting targets. Include processes where suppliers design 'credit-generating' projects or alter delivery strategies to satisfy obligations; exclude broader governance themes unless they directly affect compliance incentives."
    theme_justification: "Topic 2 centers on obligations, crediting, compliance, penalties/incentives, and multipliers, with summaries describing quantified targets that compel suppliers to design fulfillment projects. Topic 10 also notes that mandated tracking and reporting can strengthen compliance incentives even when it does not guarantee net benefit."

  - theme_id: "THEME_04"
    theme_label: "Steering supplier effort via multipliers and prioritized crediting"
    theme_description: "Crediting multipliers and prioritization rules change the relative attractiveness of different offset activities, steering supplier effort toward selected deliverables. Include processes where suppliers reallocate effort to higher-credit activities; exclude themes where prioritization is discussed only as an outcome or administrative category."
    theme_justification: "Topic 2 explicitly highlights multipliers and credited value, and its representative summaries describe multipliers steering supplier effort toward prioritized activities such as technology transfer, training, and licensing/coproduction."

  - theme_id: "THEME_05"
    theme_label: "Legitimating procurement by reframing offsets as economic benefits"
    theme_description: "Offsets provide a legitimacy resource that reframes arms procurement as economically beneficial, shifting public/political reasoning from resistance to acceptance. Include persuasion and acceptance processes (e.g., reduced perceived net costs, increased political support); exclude themes limited to technical evaluation challenges without a persuasion mechanism."
    theme_justification: "Topic 3 emphasizes promised economic benefits, acceptance, and officials' use of offsets to shift reasoning, with summaries describing reduced perceived net costs and increased public acceptance. Topic -1 also frames offsets as part of procurement strategy to make purchases politically and economically palatable."

  - theme_id: "THEME_06"
    theme_label: "Providing political cover for industrial support and sustaining prioritized producers"
    theme_description: "Offsets embed compensatory work within procurement to provide politically acceptable support to domestic producers, including sustaining inefficient or politically prioritized firms/regions. Include processes where offsets mask subsidy-like transfers or substitute for more direct reforms; exclude pure capability-building themes unless political cover is central."
    theme_justification: "Topic 13 foregrounds state support, politically prioritized allocation, and sustaining inefficient producers, with summaries describing offsets as political cover for hidden subsidies. Topic 1 also notes domestic arms-industry influence pushing demands for direct offsets that subsidize local military industry."

  - theme_id: "THEME_07"
    theme_label: "Enabling oversight through transparency, monitoring capacity, and independent auditing"
    theme_description: "Transparency and monitoring resources (data, reporting, auditing) change incentives and information, enabling scrutiny of delivery claims and reducing manipulation or overestimation. Include processes where independent oversight alters behavior or credibility; exclude supplier compliance design unless the mechanism is oversight capacity rather than obligation structure."
    theme_justification: "Topic 10 emphasizes monitoring, independent scrutiny, and hidden costs being excluded from assessments, with summaries describing how limited data prevents verification and how independent auditing can mitigate overestimation. Topic 2 also highlights structuring agreements for transparency and credible incentives to improve fulfillment."

  - theme_id: "THEME_08"
    theme_label: "Shaping bargaining leverage by constraining or expanding deal-structuring flexibility"
    theme_description: "Offset policy design changes the negotiation opportunity set by constraining or enabling trade-offs between price, scope, and in-kind industrial content. Include processes where fixed ratios reduce flexibility or variable policies expand options and comparisons; exclude downstream pricing behavior after contract terms are set."
    theme_justification: "Topic 9 focuses on negotiation, flexibility, and price-margin trade-offs, with summaries contrasting rigid fixed-percentage schemes against variable policies that expand the opportunity set and reduce diseconomies of scope."

  - theme_id: "THEME_09"
    theme_label: "Passing offset costs into prices under benchmark ambiguity"
    theme_description: "Suppliers incorporate expected offset costs into bids/prices, and limited price benchmarks create ambiguity that enables padding and reduces buyer verification. Include processes of cost pass-through and opacity-driven pricing behavior; exclude broader net-benefit assessment themes unless they operate via pricing opacity."
    theme_justification: "Topic 11 highlights vendors incorporating offset premiums and the absence of unique benchmark prices, with summaries describing embedded offset-related costs that buyers cannot readily verify."

  - theme_id: "THEME_10"
    theme_label: "Integrating local firms into multinational supply chains via joint ventures and alliances"
    theme_description: "Partnership structures (joint ventures, co-development alliances, acquisitions, subsidiaries) provide access to technology/capital/markets and embed domestic firms in multinational networks, potentially enabling specialization. Include network-integration and capability-access processes; exclude domestic-demand protection mechanisms that do not rely on cross-border integration."
    theme_justification: "Topic 4 emphasizes joint ventures, foreign firms, multinational networks, and supply-chain integration, with summaries describing alliances/acquisitions that open access to foreign technology/capital and embed firms in global supply chains."

  - theme_id: "THEME_11"
    theme_label: "Managing selection risk and access through competitive partnership strategies"
    theme_description: "Firms manage program and prime-selection risk by hedging across teams, using best-endeavors workshare norms, and leveraging cross-border industrial-base arrangements to secure access to work and learning opportunities. Include risk-hedging and access-seeking responses; exclude themes that are purely about compliance with quantified obligations."
    theme_justification: "Topic 12 highlights win-lose vs win-win exposure, risk hedging, and best-endeavors work allocation, with summaries describing how partnership structure changes access to development roles and work shares subject to technology access constraints."

  - theme_id: "THEME_12"
    theme_label: "Managing trade, reciprocal purchasing, and foreign-exchange constraints through countertrade"
    theme_description: "Offsets act as reciprocal purchasing/countertrade resources that respond to domestic expectations about import impacts and to foreign-exchange constraints, sometimes without improving net FX. Include processes involving reciprocal purchases, countertrade/barter, or long-term credit used to manage constraints; exclude production-scale viability mechanisms unrelated to trade/FX."
    theme_justification: "Topic 5 centers on exports, reciprocal purchases, and foreign exchange, with summaries describing obligations compelling additional purchases and ambiguous net FX effects. Topic 7 also links procurement embedding countertrade/barter and credit to managing foreign exchange constraints."

  - theme_id: "THEME_13"
    theme_label: "Encountering scale constraints that drive export dependence and sustainment uncertainty"
    theme_description: "Small domestic demand increases unit costs and sustainment uncertainty, which pushes actors toward exports to reach break-even quantities while credibility and market constraints limit export success. Include scale-economy and viability processes; exclude negotiation themes focused on price/content trade-offs."
    theme_justification: "Topic 6 highlights small orders, high unit costs, export dependence for break-even, and uncertainty about parts/sustainment, with summaries describing market/credibility constraints that impede exports."

  - theme_id: "THEME_14"
    theme_label: "Directing investment to regions while externalizing hidden public costs"
    theme_description: "Offsets are used to steer investment toward selected regions/sectors, but capital-intensive projects can require substantial additional state support and may be chosen for political fit rather than viability. Include processes of regional steering, selection, and hidden-cost externalization; exclude national-level industrial support mechanisms without a regional targeting logic."
    theme_justification: "Topic 8 emphasizes regional projects, capital intensity, and hidden costs being excluded from assessments, with summaries describing additional state investment/incentives and politically driven project selection increasing failure risk."

  - theme_id: "THEME_15"
    theme_label: "Prioritizing defense technological competence via military-focused offsets"
    theme_description: "Policy actors focus offset requirements on military/defense technology priorities (rather than diffuse civilian aims) to secure defense technological competence, shaped by defense-industrial interests and strategic selection. Include focusing/prioritization processes tied to defense competence; exclude generic statements about military spending without a focusing logic."
    theme_justification: "Topic 1 emphasizes military arms offsets and shifts from civil to military priorities, with summaries describing focusing on prioritized technology fields and domestic industry influence pushing direct offsets that support defense industrial capability."
