        statement: "In contexts where buyers face information asymmetry about the quality of transferred plant technology, buyback obligations that make sellers responsible for purchasing output tends to yield reduced technology-quality risk by aligning seller incentives to avoid transferring obsolete or low-quality technology."
        context_conditions:
          - "Technology-transfer transactions involve strong information asymmetries about process quality/value."
          - "Contracts include buyback obligations that require the seller/exporter to absorb output from the transferred facility."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Incentives are aligned so sellers avoid undermining the buyback by transferring outdated technology."
          - "Recipients face reduced risk of receiving substandard technology packages compared with a one-off transfer."

        statement: "In contexts where exporters face buyer skepticism about product quality and reputation, buyback commitments tends to yield a credible quality signal that supports market access and can improve realized prices for the output."
        context_conditions:
          - "Exporters/producers face quality and reputation uncertainty in target markets."
          - "Buyback arrangements commit the exporter to purchase (and thus help market) the output."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Buyers interpret buyback as a signal of higher-than-baseline product quality."
          - "Output can gain access in higher-standard markets and/or command higher prices."

        statement: "In contexts where host-country rules prohibit FDI and contracts cannot specify or enforce technology-process quality, buyback arrangements tends to yield a second-best governance device by tying obligations to observable output and ongoing relationships, enabling technology transfer that otherwise would be blocked or risky."
        context_conditions:
          - "FDI/ownership solutions are unavailable due to host-country restrictions."
          - "Quality-contingent contracting is infeasible or unenforceable."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Transactions proceed via buyback/countertrade structures that link compensation to future observable output."

        confidence_justification: "A medium-confidence CMO explicitly states the constraint (no FDI and no enforceable quality contract) and positions buyback as a second-best mechanism, but broader empirical confirmation is limited."
    theme_notes:
      - "Coverage: all 4 PM26 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence supports a core governance logic: buyback creates 'hostageship' that mitigates technology-transfer quality risk under information asymmetry."
      - "Secondary pathways include buyback as a quality signal and as a second-best mechanism under FDI and contract-enforcement constraints."
