        statement: "In contexts where policymakers believe local suppliers may be world-competitive but foreign primes are unaware or reluctant to restructure supply chains, local content requirements that compel primes to search and engage domestic suppliers tends to yield reduced information imperfections and reveal whether local capability is truly competitive."
        context_conditions:
          - "Potentially competitive local suppliers exist but primes lack information and face switching frictions."
          - "Local content requirements compel supplier search and engagement."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Local supplier capability is revealed through search and trial engagement."
          - "Import substitution may occur at little extra cost if capability is competitive (otherwise premiums persist)."

        statement: "In contexts where offset programmes are implemented as facilitated search-and-match processes with private-sector partner selection, offsets revealing local supplier capability tends to yield long-term partnerships and joint ventures rather than one-off countertrade transactions."
        context_conditions:

        statement: "In contexts where offsets primarily place domestic firms on bidders’ lists but orders are awarded under competitive selection, offsets revealing local supplier capability tends to yield no guaranteed orders; orders occur only when domestic firms are competitive on price, quality, and delivery."

          - "Procurement remains competitive on price, quality, and delivery."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Offset commitments do not guarantee orders; offset effects are mediated by competitiveness."

      - "Evidence supports two pathways: (a) local content as an information-imperfection correction, and (b) offsets as facilitated partner-search creating longer-term ventures."
      - "A key boundary condition is competitiveness: offsets may increase visibility/listing but do not guarantee orders."
