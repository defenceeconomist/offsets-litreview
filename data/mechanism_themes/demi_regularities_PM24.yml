        statement: "In contexts where an importing country’s exports are inhibited by macro constraints (e.g., an overvalued currency), indirect offsets requiring the exporter to purchase goods from the importer tends to yield sector-specific export stimulation that functions like a selective devaluation for the targeted sector."
