    mechanism_explanation: "When offsets pursue economy-wide objectives but the defence ministry bears the procurement cost premium, defence resources are diverted from capability, especially in the absence of cross-departmental cost-sharing."

        statement: "In contexts where offsets pursue broad economic objectives that benefit society beyond defence, but the defence ministry bears the offset cost premium without cross-departmental cost-sharing, defence bearing economic-policy cost burden tends to yield reduced defence purchasing power and opportunity costs that can degrade or delay military capability acquisition."
        context_conditions:
          - "Offset programmes serve economy-wide objectives beyond the defence ministry’s operational remit."
          - "Defence budgets absorb offset premiums and opportunity costs without offset-related cost-sharing by other departments."
        outcome_tendencies:
          - "Defence purchasing power is reduced and capability acquisition can be degraded or delayed."

        statement: "In contexts where negotiating and implementing offset/IRB packages introduces additional and opportunity costs relative to cost-effective sourcing, defence bearing economic-policy cost burden tends to yield measurable additional costs absorbed by defence departments."
        context_conditions:

        statement: "In contexts where domestic firms are less efficient than established suppliers and contractors are unwilling to pay above normal subcontracting costs, defence bearing economic-policy cost burden tends to yield public subsidisation of the cost premium to make direct-offset work viable for domestic suppliers."

      - "Coverage: all 4 PM88 mechanisms were found in data/cmo_statements.csv; missing_cmo_ids is empty."
      - "Evidence consistently highlights a budgeting mismatch: defence resources bear costs for wider economic objectives, creating opportunity costs for capability."
      - "Within-theme variation shows multiple cost channels: general purchasing-power diversion, measurable additional costs, and explicit public subsidy to cover direct-offset cost premiums."
